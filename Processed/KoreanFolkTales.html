</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To any one who would like to look somewhat into the
inner soul of the Oriental, and see the peculiar spiritual existences
among which he lives, the following stories will serve as true
interpreters, born as they are of the three great religions of the Far
East, Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism.</p>
<p>An old manuscript copy of Im Bang&rsquo;s stories came into the
hands of the translator a year ago, and he gives them now to the
Western world that they may serve as introductory essays to the
mysteries, and, what many call, absurdities of Asia. Very gruesome
indeed, and unlovely, some of them are, but they picture faithfully the
conditions under which Im Bang himself, and many past generations of
Koreans, have lived.</p>
<p>The thirteen short stories by Yi Ryuk are taken from a reprint of
old Korean writings issued last year (1911), by a Japanese publishing
company. Three anonymous stories are also added, &ldquo;The
Geomancer,&rdquo; to show how Mother Earth has given anxiety to her
chicks of children; &ldquo;Im, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e196" href="#xd25e196" name="xd25e196">8</a>]</span>Hunter,&rdquo;
to tell of the actualities that exist in the upper air; and &ldquo;The
Man who lost his Legs,&rdquo; as a sample of Korea&rsquo;s Sinbad.</p>
<p>The biographical notes that accompany the stories are taken very
largely from the <i>Kuk-cho In-mul-chi</i>, &ldquo;Korea&rsquo;s Record
of Famous Men.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Im Bang was born in 1640, the son of a provincial
governor. He was very bright as a boy and from earliest years fond of
study, becoming a great scholar. He matriculated first in his class in
1660, and graduated in 1663. He was a disciple of Song Si-yol, one of
Korea&rsquo;s first writers. In 1719, when he was in his eightieth
year, he became governor of Seoul, and held as well the office of
secretary of the Cabinet. In the year 1721 he got into difficulties
over the choice of the Heir Apparent, and in 1722, on account of a part
he played in a disturbance in the government, he was exiled to North
Korea, where he died.</p>

<p class="first">[Some think that love, strong, true, and
self-sacrificing, is not to be found in the Orient; but the story of
Charan, which comes down four hundred years and more, proves the
contrary, for it still has the fresh, sweet flavour of a romance of
yesterday; albeit the setting of the East provides an odd and
interesting background.]</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In the days of King Sung-jong (<span class="sc">A.D.</span>
1488&ndash;1495) one of Korea&rsquo;s noted men became governor of
Pyong-an Province. Now Pyong-an stands first of all the eight provinces
in the attainments of erudition and polite society. Many of her
<i>literati</i> are good musicians, and show ability in the affairs of
State. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e739" href="#xd25e739" name=
"xd25e739">14</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the time of this story there was a famous dancing girl in
Pyong-an whose name was Charan. She was very beautiful, and sang and
danced to the delight of all beholders. Her ability, too, was specially
marked, for she understood the classics and was acquainted with
history. The brightest of all the <i>geisha</i> was she, famous and
far-renowned.</p>
<p>The Governor&rsquo;s family consisted of a son, whose age was
sixteen, and whose face was comely as a picture. Though so young, he
was thoroughly grounded in Chinese, and was a gifted scholar. His
judgment was excellent, and he had a fine appreciation of literary
form, so that the moment he lifted his pen the written line took on
admirable expression. His name became known as Keydong (The Gifted
Lad). The Governor had no other children, neither son nor daughter, so
his heart was wrapped up in this boy. On his birthday he had all the
officials invited and other special guests, who came to drink his
health. There were present also a company of dancing-girls and a large
band of musicians. The Governor, during a lull in the banquet, called
his son to him, and ordered the chief of the dancing-girls to choose
one of the prettiest of their number, that he and she might dance
together and delight the assembled guests. On hearing this, the
company, with one accord, called for Charan, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e747" href="#xd25e747" name=
"xd25e747">15</a>]</span>as the one suited by her talents, attainments
and age to be a fitting partner for his son. They came out and danced
like fairies, graceful as the wavings of the willow, light and airy as
the swallow. All who saw them were charmed. The Governor, too, greatly
pleased, called Charan to him, had her sit on the dais, treated her to
a share in the banquet, gave her a present of silk, and commanded that
from that day forth she be the special dancing maiden to attend upon
his son.</p>
<p>From this birthday forth they became fast friends together. They
thought the world of each other. More than all the delightful stories
of history was their love&mdash;such as had never been seen.</p>
<p>The Governor&rsquo;s term of office was extended for six years more,
and so they remained in the north country. Finally, at the time of
return, he and his wife were in great anxiety over their son being
separated from Charan. If they were to force them to separate, they
feared he would die of a broken heart. If they took her with them, she
not being his wife, they feared for his reputation. They could not
possibly decide, so they concluded to refer the matter to the son
himself. They called him and said, &ldquo;Even parents cannot decide as
to the love of their son for a maiden. What ought we to do? You love
Charan so that it will be very hard for you to part, and yet to have a
dancing-girl before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e753" href=
"#xd25e753" name="xd25e753">16</a>]</span>you are married is not good
form, and will interfere with your marriage prospects and promotion.
However, the having of a second wife is a common custom in Korea, and
one that the world recognizes. Do as you think best in the
matter.&rdquo; The son replied, &ldquo;There is no difficulty; when she
is before my eyes, of course she is everything, but when the time comes
for me to start for home she will be like a pair of worn shoes, set
aside; so please do not be anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor and his wife were greatly delighted, and said he was a
&ldquo;superior man&rdquo; indeed.</p>
<p>When the time came to part Charan cried bitterly, so that those
standing by could not bear to look at her; but the son showed not the
slightest sign of emotion. Those looking on were filled with wonder at
his fortitude. Although he had already loved Charan for six years, he
had never been separated from her for a single day, so he knew not what
it meant to say Good-bye, nor did he know how it felt to be parted.</p>
<p>The Governor returned to Seoul to fill the office of Chief Justice,
and the son came also. After this return thoughts of love for Charan
possessed Keydong, though he never expressed them in word or manner. It
was almost the time of the <i>Kam-see</i> Examination. The father,
therefore, ordered his son to go with some of his friends to a
neighbouring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e765" href="#xd25e765"
name="xd25e765">17</a>]</span>monastery to study and prepare. They
went, and one night, after the day&rsquo;s work was over and all were
asleep, the young man stole out into the courtyard. It was winter, with
frost and snow and a cold, clear moon. The mountains were deep and the
world was quiet, so that the slightest sound could be heard. The young
man looked up at the moon and his thoughts were full of sorrow. He so
wished to see Charan that he could no longer control himself, and
fearing that he would lose his reason, he decided that very night to
set out for far-distant Pyong-an. He had on a fur head-dress, a thick
coat, a leather belt and a heavy pair of shoes. When he had gone less
than ten <i>lee</i>, however, his feet were blistered, and he had to go
into a neighbouring village and change his leather shoes for straw
sandals, and his expensive head-cover for an ordinary servant&rsquo;s
hat. He went thus on his way, begging as he went. He was often very
hungry, and when night came, was very, very cold. He was a rich
man&rsquo;s son and had always dressed in silk and eaten dainty fare,
and had never in his life walked more than a few feet from his
father&rsquo;s door. Now there lay before him a journey of hundreds of
miles. He went stumbling along through the snow, making but poor
progress. Hungry, and frozen nearly to death, he had never known such
suffering before. His clothes were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e770" href="#xd25e770" name="xd25e770">18</a>]</span>torn and his
face became worn down and blackened till he looked like a goblin. Still
on he went, little by little, day after day, till at last, when a whole
month had gone by, he reached Pyong-an.</p>
<p>Straight to Charan&rsquo;s home he went, but Charan was not there,
only her mother. She looked at him, but did not recognize him. He said
he was the former Governor&rsquo;s son and that out of love for Charan
he had walked five hundred <i>lee</i>. &ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo; he
asked. The mother heard, but instead of being pleased was very angry.
She said, &ldquo;My daughter is now with the son of the new Governor,
and I never see her at all; she never comes home, and she has been away
for two or three months. Even though you have made this long journey
there is no possible way to meet her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not invite him in, so cold was her welcome. He thought to
himself, &ldquo;I came to see Charan, but she is not here. Her mother
refuses me; I cannot go back, and I cannot stay. What shall I
do?&rdquo; While thus in this dilemma a plan occurred to him. There was
a scribe in Pyong-an, who, during his father&rsquo;s term of office,
had offended, and was sentenced to death. There were extenuating
circumstances, however, and he, when he went to pay his morning
salutations, had besought and secured his pardon. His father, out of
regard for his son&rsquo;s petition, had forgiven the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e779" href="#xd25e779" name=
"xd25e779">19</a>]</span>scribe. He thought, &ldquo;I was the means of
saving the man&rsquo;s life, he will take me in;&rdquo; so he went
straight from Charan&rsquo;s to the house of the scribe. But at first
this writer did not recognize him. When he gave his name and told who
he was, the scribe gave a great start, and fell at his feet making
obeisance. He cleared out an inner room and made him comfortable,
prepared dainty fare and treated him with all respect.</p>
<p>A little later he talked over with his host the possibility of his
meeting Charan. The scribe said, &ldquo;I am afraid that there is no
way for you to meet her alone, but if you would like to see even her
face, I think I can manage it. Will you consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He asked as to the plan. It was this: It being now a time of snow,
daily coolies were called to sweep it away from the inner court of the
Governor&rsquo;s <i>yamen</i>, and just now the scribe was in charge of
this particular work. Said he, &ldquo;If you will join the sweepers,
take a broom and go in; you will no doubt catch a glimpse of Charan as
she is said to be in the Hill Kiosk. I know of no other
plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keydong consented. In the early morning he mixed with the company of
sweepers and went with his broom into the inner enclosure, where the
Hill Kiosk was, and so they worked at sweeping. Just then the
Governor&rsquo;s son was sitting by the open window and Charan was by
him, but not visible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e790" href=
"#xd25e790" name="xd25e790">20</a>]</span>from the outside. The other
workers, being all practised hands, swept well; Keydong alone handled
his broom to no advantage, knowing not how to sweep. The
Governor&rsquo;s son, watching the process, looked out and laughed,
called Charan and invited her to see this sweeper. Charan stepped out
into the open hall and the sweeper raised his eyes to see. She glanced
at him but once, and but for a moment, then turned quickly, went into
the room, and shut the door, not appearing again, to the disappointment
of the sweeper, who came back in despair to the scribe&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>Charan was first of all a wise and highly gifted woman. One look had
told her who the sweeper was. She came back into the room and began to
cry. The Governor&rsquo;s son looked in surprise and displeasure, and
asked, &ldquo;Why do you cry?&rdquo; She did not reply at once, but
after two or three insistent demands told the reason thus: &ldquo;I am
a low class woman; you are mistaken in thinking highly of me, or
counting me of worth. Already I have not been home for two whole months
and more. This is a special compliment and a high honour, and so there
is not the slightest reason for any complaint on my part. But still, I
think of my home, which is poor, and my mother. It is customary on the
anniversary of my father&rsquo;s death to prepare food from the
official quarters, and offer a sacrifice to his spirit, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e794" href="#xd25e794" name=
"xd25e794">21</a>]</span>but here I am imprisoned and to-morrow is the
sacrificial day. I fear that not a single act of devotion will be paid,
I am disturbed over it, and that&rsquo;s why I cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor&rsquo;s son was so taken in by this fair statement that
he trusted her fully and without a question. Sympathetically he asked,
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?&rdquo; He prepared the food
and told her to hurry home and carry out the ceremony. So Charan came
like flaming fire back to her house, and said to her mother,
&ldquo;Keydong has come and I have seen him. Is he not here? Tell me
where he is if you know.&rdquo; The mother said, &ldquo;He came here,
it is true, all the way on foot to see you, but I told him that you
were in the <i>yamen</i> and that there was no possible way for you to
meet, so he went away and where he is I know not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Charan broke down and began to cry. &ldquo;Oh, my mother, why
had you the heart to do so cruelly?&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;As far as
I am concerned I can never break with him nor give him up. We were each
sixteen when chosen to dance together, and while it may be said that
men chose us, it is truer still to say that God hath chosen. We grew
into each other&rsquo;s lives, and there was never such love as ours.
Though he forgot and left me, I can never forget and can never give him
up. The Governor, too, called me the beloved wife of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e803" href="#xd25e803" name=
"xd25e803">22</a>]</span>son, and did not once refer to my low station.
He cherished me and gave me many gifts. &rsquo;Twas all like heaven and
not like earth. To the city of Pyong-an gentry and officials gather as
men crowd into a boat; I have seen so many, but for grace and ability
no one was ever like Keydong. I must find him, and even though he casts
me aside I never shall forget him. I have not kept myself even unto
death as I should have, because I have been under the power and
influence of the Governor. How could he ever have come so far for one
so low and vile? He, a gentleman of the highest birth, for the sake of
a wretched dancing-girl has endured all this hardship and come so far.
Could you not have thought, mother, of these things and given him at
least some kindly welcome? Could my heart be other than broken?&rdquo;
And a great flow of tears came from Charan&rsquo;s eyes. She thought
and thought as to where he could possibly be. &ldquo;I know of no
place,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;unless it be at such and such a
scribe&rsquo;s home.&rdquo; Quick as thought she flew thence, and there
they met. They clasped each other and cried, not a word was spoken.
Thus came they back to Charan&rsquo;s home side by side. When it was
night Charan said, &ldquo;When to-morrow comes we shall have to part.
What shall we do?&rdquo; They talked it over, and agreed to make their
escape that night. So Charan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e805"
href="#xd25e805" name="xd25e805">23</a>]</span>got together her
clothing, and her treasures and jewels, and made two bundles, and thus,
he carrying his on his back and she hers on her head, away they went
while the city slept. They followed the road that leads toward the
mountains that lie between Yang-tok and Maing-san counties. There they
found a country house, where they put up, and where the
Governor&rsquo;s son became a sort of better-class servant. He did not
know how to do anything well, but Charan understood weaving and sewing,
and so they lived. After some time they got a little thatched hut by
themselves in the village and lived there. Charan was a beautiful
sewing-woman, and ceased not day and night to ply her needle, and sold
her treasures and her jewels to make ends meet. Charan, too, knew how
to make friends, and was praised and loved by all the village.
Everybody felt sorry for the hard times that had befallen this
mysterious young couple, and helped them so that the days passed
peacefully and happily together.</p>
<p>To return in the story: On awaking in the morning in the temple
where he and his friends had gone to study, they found Keydong missing.
All was in a state of confusion as to what had become of the son of the
Chief Justice. They hunted for him far and wide, but he was nowhere to
be found, so word was sent to the parents accordingly. There
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e809" href="#xd25e809" name=
"xd25e809">24</a>]</span>was untold consternation in the home of the
former governor. So great a loss, what could equal it? They searched
the country about the temple, but no trace or shadow of him was to be
found. Some said they thought he had been inveigled away and
metamorphosed by the fox; others that he had been eaten by the tiger.
The parents decided that he was dead and went into mourning for him,
burning his clothing in a sacrificial fire.</p>
<p>In Pyong-an the Governor&rsquo;s son, when he found that he had lost
Charan, had Charan&rsquo;s mother imprisoned and all the relatives, but
after a month or so, when the search proved futile, he gave up the
matter and let them go.</p>
<p>Charan, at last happy with her chosen one, said one day to him,
&ldquo;You, a son of the gentry, for the sake of a dancing-girl have
given up parents and home to live in this hidden corner of the hills.
It is a matter, too, that touches your filial piety, this leaving your
father and mother in doubt as to whether you are alive or not. They
ought to know. We cannot live here all our lives, neither can we return
home; what do you think we ought to do?&rdquo; Keydong made a hopeless
reply. &ldquo;I am in distress,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and know
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charan said brightly, &ldquo;I have a plan by which we can cover
over the faults of the past, and win a new start for the future. By
means of it, you can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e818" href=
"#xd25e818" name="xd25e818">25</a>]</span>serve your parents and look
the world in the face. Will you consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose?&rdquo; asked he. Her reply was,
&ldquo;There is only one way, and that is by means of the Official
Examination. I know of no other. You will understand what I mean, even
though I do not tell you more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Enough, your plan is just the thing to help us out.
But how can I get hold of the books I need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charan replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be anxious about that, I&rsquo;ll
get the books.&rdquo; From that day forth she sent through all the
neighbourhood for books, to be secured at all costs; but there were few
or none, it being a mountain village. One day there came by, all
unexpectedly, a pack-peddler, who had in his bundle a book that he
wished to sell. Some of the village people wanted to buy it for
wall-paper. Charan, however, secured it first and showed it to Keydong.
It was none other than a special work for Examinations, with all the
exercises written out. It was written in small characters, and was a
huge book containing several thousand exercises. Keydong was delighted,
and said, &ldquo;This is enough for all needed preparation.&rdquo; She
bought it and gave it to him, and there he pegged away day after day.
In the night he studied by candle-light, while she sat by his side and
did silk-spinning. Thus they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e826"
href="#xd25e826" name="xd25e826">26</a>]</span>shared the light
together. If he showed any remissness, Charan urged him on, and thus
they worked for two years. To begin with, he, being a highly talented
scholar, made steady advancement day by day. He was a beautiful writer
and a master of the pen. His compositions, too, were without a peer,
and every indication pointed to his winning the highest place in the
<i>Kwago</i> (Examination).</p>
<p>At this time a proclamation was issued that there would be a special
examination held before His Majesty the King, so Charan made ready the
food required and all necessaries for him to go afoot to Seoul to try
his hand.</p>
<p>At last here he was, within the Palace enclosure. His Majesty came
out into the examination arena and posted up the subject. Keydong took
his pen and wrote his finished composition. Under the inspiration of
the moment his lines came forth like bubbling water. It was
finished.</p>
<p>When the announcement was made as to the winner, the King ordered
the sealed name of the writer to be opened. It was, and they found that
Keydong was first. At that time his father was Prime Minister and
waiting in attendance upon the King. The King called the Prime
Minister, and said, &ldquo;It looks to me as though the winner was your
son, but he writes that his father is Chief Justice and not Prime
Minister; what can that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e837" href=
"#xd25e837" name="xd25e837">27</a>]</span>mean?&rdquo; He handed the
composition paper to the father, and asked him to look and see. The
Minister gazed at it in wonder, burst into tears, and said, &ldquo;It
is your servant&rsquo;s son. Three years ago he went with some friends
to a monastery to study, but one night he disappeared, and though I
searched far and wide I have had no word of him since. I concluded that
he had been destroyed by some wild animal, so I had a funeral service
held and the house went into mourning. I had no other children but this
son only. He was greatly gifted and I lost him in this strange way. The
memory has never left me, for it seems as though I had lost him but
yesterday. Now that I look at this paper I see indeed that it is the
writing of my son. When I lost him I was Chief Justice, and thus he
records the office; but where he has been for these three years, and
how he comes now to take part in the examination, I know
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King, hearing this, was greatly astonished, and at once before
all the assembled ministers had him called. Thus he came in his
scholar&rsquo;s dress into the presence of the King. All the officials
wondered at this summoning of a candidate before the announcement of
the result. The King asked him why he had left the monastery and where
he had been for these three years. He bowed low, and said, &ldquo;I
have been a very wicked man, have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e841" href="#xd25e841" name="xd25e841">28</a>]</span>left my
parents, have broken all the laws of filial devotion, and deserve
condign punishment.&rdquo; The King replied, saying, &ldquo;There is no
law of concealment before the King. I shall not condemn you even though
you are guilty; tell me all.&rdquo; Then he told his story to the King.
All the officials on each side bent their ears to hear. The King
sighed, and said to the father, &ldquo;Your son has repented and made
amends for his fault. He has won first place and now stands as a member
of the Court. We cannot condemn him for his love for this woman.
Forgive him for all the past and give him a start for the
future.&rdquo; His Majesty said further, &ldquo;The woman Charan, who
has shared your life in the lonely mountains, is no common woman. Her
plans, too, for your restoration were the plans of a master hand. She
is no dancing-girl, this Charan. Let no other be your lawful wife but
she only; let her be raised to equal rank with her husband, and let her
children and her children&rsquo;s children hold highest office in the
realm.&rdquo; So was Keydong honoured with the winner&rsquo;s crown,
and so the Prime Minister received his son back to life at the hands of
the King. The winner&rsquo;s cap was placed upon his head, and the
whole house was whirled into raptures of joy.</p>
<p>So the Minister sent forth a palanquin and servants to bring up
Charan. In a great festival <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e845"
href="#xd25e845" name="xd25e845">29</a>]</span>of joy she was
proclaimed the wife of the Minister&rsquo;s son. Later he became one of
Korea&rsquo;s first men of State, and they lived their happy life to a
good old age. They had two sons, both graduates and men who held high
office.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE STORY OF CHANG TO-RYONG</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Taoism has been one of the great religions of Korea.
Its main thought is expressed in the phrase <i>su-sim yon-song</i>,
&ldquo;to correct the mind and reform the nature&rdquo;; while
Buddhism&rsquo;s is <i>myong-sim kyon-song</i>, &ldquo;to enlighten the
heart and see the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The desire of all Taoists is &ldquo;eternal life,&rdquo;
<i>chang-saing pul-sa</i>; that of the Buddhists, to rid oneself of
fleshly being. In the Taoist world of the genii, there are three great
divisions: the upper genii, who live with God; the midway genii, who
have to do with the world of angels and spirits; and the lower genii,
who rule in sacred places on the earth, among the hills, just as we
find in the story of Chang To-ryong.]</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>In the days of King Chung-jong (<span class="sc">A.D.</span>
1507&ndash;1526) there lived a beggar in Seoul, whose face was
extremely ugly and always dirty. He was forty years of age or so, but
still wore his hair down his back like an unmarried boy. He carried
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e877" href="#xd25e877" name=
"xd25e877">31</a>]</span>a bag over his shoulder, and went about the
streets begging. During the day he went from one part of the city to
the other, visiting each section, and when night came on he would
huddle up beside some one&rsquo;s gate and go to sleep. He was
frequently seen in Chong-no (Bell Street) in company with the servants
and underlings of the rich. They were great friends, he and they,
joking and bantering as they met. He used to say that his name was
Chang, and so they called him Chang To-ryong, To-ryong meaning an
unmarried boy, son of the gentry. At that time the magician Chon U-chi,
who was far-famed for his pride and arrogance, whenever he met Chang,
in passing along the street, would dismount and prostrate himself most
humbly. Not only did he bow, but he seemed to regard Chang with the
greatest of fear, so that he dared not look him in the face. Chang,
sometimes, without even inclining his head, would say, &ldquo;Well, how
goes it with you, eh?&rdquo; Chon, with his hands in his sleeves, most
respectfully would reply, &ldquo;Very well, sir, thank you, very
well.&rdquo; He had fear written on all his features when he faced
Chang.</p>
<p>Sometimes, too, when Chon would bow, Chang would refuse to notice
him at all, and go by without a word. Those who saw it were astonished,
and asked Chon the reason. Chon said in reply, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e881" href="#xd25e881" name=
"xd25e881">32</a>]</span>&ldquo;There are only three spirit-men at
present in Cho-sen, of whom the greatest is Chang To-ryong; the second
is Cheung Puk-chang; and the third is Yun Se-pyong. People of the world
do not know it, but I do. Such being the case, should I not bow before
him and show him reverence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who heard this explanation, knowing that Chon himself was a
strange being, paid no attention to it.</p>
<p>At that time in Seoul there was a certain literary undergraduate in
office whose house joined hard on the street. This man used to see
Chang frequently going about begging, and one day he called him and
asked who he was, and why he begged. Chang made answer, &ldquo;I was
originally of a cultured family of Chulla Province, but my parents died
of typhus fever, and I had no brothers or relations left to share my
lot. I alone remained of all my clan, and having no home of my own I
have gone about begging, and have at last reached Seoul. As I am not
skilled in any handicraft, and do not know Chinese letters, what else
can I do?&rdquo; The undergraduate, hearing that he was a scholar, felt
very sorry for him, gave him food and drink, and refreshed him.</p>
<p>From this time on, whenever there was any special celebration at his
home, he used to call Chang in and have him share it. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e889" href="#xd25e889" name=
"xd25e889">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>On a certain day when the master was on his way to office, he saw a
dead body being carried on a stretcher off toward the Water Gate.
Looking at it closely from the horse on which he rode, he recognized it
as the corpse of Chang To-ryong. He felt so sad that he turned back to
his house and cried over it, saying, &ldquo;There are lots of miserable
people on earth, but who ever saw one as miserable as poor Chang? As I
reckon the time over on my fingers, he has been begging in Bell Street
for fifteen years, and now he passes out of the city a dead
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twenty years and more afterwards the master had to make a journey
through South Chulla Province. As he was passing Chi-i Mountain, he
lost his way and got into a maze among the hills. The day began to
wane, and he could neither return nor go forward. He saw a narrow
footpath, such as woodmen take, and turned into it to see if it led to
any habitation. As he went along there were rocks and deep ravines.
Little by little, as he advanced farther, the scene changed and seemed
to become strangely transfigured. The farther he went the more
wonderful it became. After he had gone some miles he discovered himself
to be in another world entirely, no longer a world of earth and dust.
He saw some one coming toward him dressed in ethereal green, mounted
and carrying a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e894" href="#xd25e894"
name="xd25e894">34</a>]</span>shade, with servants accompanying. He
seemed to sweep toward him with swiftness and without effort. He
thought to himself, &ldquo;Here is some high lord or other coming to
meet me, but,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;how among these deeps and
solitudes could a gentleman come riding so?&rdquo; He led his horse
aside and tried to withdraw into one of the groves by the side of the
way, but before he could think to turn the man had reached him. The
mysterious stranger lifted his two hands in salutation and inquired
respectfully as to how he had been all this time. The master was
speechless, and so astonished that he could make no reply. But the
stranger smilingly said, &ldquo;My house is quite near here; come with
me and rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned, and leading the way seemed to glide and not to walk,
while the master followed. At last they reached the place indicated. He
suddenly saw before him great palace halls filling whole squares of
space. Beautiful buildings they were, richly ornamented. Before the
door attendants in official robes awaited them. They bowed to the
master and led him into the hall. After passing a number of gorgeous,
palace-like rooms, he arrived at a special one and ascended to the
upper storey, where he met a very wonderful person. He was dressed in
shining garments, and the servants that waited on him were exceedingly
fair. There were, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e899" href=
"#xd25e899" name="xd25e899">35</a>]</span>too, children about, so
exquisitely beautiful that it seemed none other than a celestial
palace. The master, alarmed at finding himself in such a place, hurried
forward and made a low obeisance, not daring to lift his eyes. But the
host smiled upon him, raised his hands and asked, &ldquo;Do you not
know me? Look now.&rdquo; Lifting his eyes, he then saw that it was the
same person who had come riding out to meet him, but he could not tell
who he was. &ldquo;I see you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but as to who you
are I cannot tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kingly host then said, &ldquo;I am Chang To-ryong. Do you not
know me?&rdquo; Then as the master looked more closely at him he could
see the same features. The outlines of the face were there, but all the
imperfections had gone, and only beauty remained. So wonderful was it
that he was quite overcome.</p>
<p>A great feast was prepared, and the honoured guest was entertained.
Such food, too, was placed before him as was never seen on earth.
Angelic beings played on beautiful instruments and danced as no mortal
eye ever looked upon. Their faces, too, were like pearls and precious
stones.</p>
<p>Chang To-ryong said to his guest, &ldquo;There are four famous
mountains in Korea in which the genii reside. This hill is one. In days
gone by, for a fault of mine, I was exiled to earth, and in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e907" href="#xd25e907" name=
"xd25e907">36</a>]</span>the time of my exile you treated me with
marked kindness, a favour that I have never forgotten. When you saw my
dead body your pity went out to me; this, too, I remember. I was not
dead then, it was simply that my days of exile were ended and I was
returning home. I knew that you were passing this hill, and I desired
to meet you and to thank you for all your kindness. Your treatment of
me in another world is sufficient to bring about our meeting in this
one.&rdquo; And so they met and feasted in joy and great delight.</p>
<p>When night came he was escorted to a special pavilion, where he was
to sleep. The windows were made of jade and precious stones, and soft
lights came streaming through them, so that there was no night.
&ldquo;My body was so rested and my soul so refreshed,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that I felt no need of sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the day dawned a new feast was spread, and then farewells were
spoken. Chang said, &ldquo;This is not a place for you to stay long in;
you must go. The ways differ of we genii and you men of the world. It
will be difficult for us ever to meet again. Take good care of yourself
and go in peace.&rdquo; He then called a servant to accompany him and
show the way. The master made a low bow and withdrew. When he had gone
but a short distance he suddenly found himself in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e913" href="#xd25e913" name=
"xd25e913">37</a>]</span>old world with its dusty accompaniments. The
path by which he came out was not the way by which he had entered. In
order to mark the entrance he planted a stake, and then the servant
withdrew and disappeared.</p>
<p>The year following the master went again and tried to find the
citadel of the genii, but there were only mountain peaks and impassable
ravines, and where it was he never could discover.</p>
<p>As the years went by the master seemed to grow younger in spirit,
and at last at the age of ninety he passed away without suffering.
&ldquo;When Chang was here on earth and I saw him for fifteen
years,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;I remember but one peculiarity
about him, namely, that his face never grew older nor did his dirty
clothing ever wear out. He never changed his garb, and yet it never
varied in appearance in all the fifteen years. This alone would have
marked him as a strange being, but our fleshly eyes did not recognize
it.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb">
<p>Yi Kwai was the son of a minister. He passed his examinations and
held high office. When his father was Governor of Pyong-an Province,
Kwai was a little boy and accompanied him. The Governor&rsquo;s first
wife being dead, Kwai&rsquo;s stepmother was the mistress of the home.
Once when His Excellency had gone out on an inspecting tour, the
<i>yamen</i> was left vacant, and Kwai was there with her. In the rear
garden of the official quarters was a pavilion, called the Hill Pagoda,
that was connected by a narrow gateway with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e938" href="#xd25e938" name=
"xd25e938">39</a>]</span>public hall. Frequently Kwai took one of the
<i>yamen</i> boys with him and went there to study, and once at night
when it had grown late and the boy who accompanied him had taken his
departure, the door opened suddenly and a young woman came in. Her
clothes were neat and clean, and she was very pretty. Kwai looked
carefully at her, but did not recognize her. She was evidently a
stranger, as there was no such person among the dancing-girls of the
<i>yamen</i>.</p>
<p>He remained looking at her, in doubt as to who she was, while she on
the other hand took her place in the corner of the room and said
nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked. She merely laughed and made no
reply. He called her. She came and knelt down before him, and he took
her by the hand and patted her shoulder, as though he greeted her
favourably. The woman smiled and pretended to enjoy it. He concluded,
however, that she was not a real woman, but a goblin of some kind, or
perhaps a fox, and what to do he knew not. Suddenly he decided on a
plan, caught her, swung her on to his back, and rushed out through the
gate into the <i>yamen</i> quarters, where he shouted at the top of his
voice for his stepmother and the servants to come.</p>
<p>It was midnight and all were asleep. No one replied, and no one
came. The woman, then, being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e955"
href="#xd25e955" name="xd25e955">40</a>]</span>on his back, bit him
furiously at the nape of the neck. By this he knew that she was the
fox. Unable to stand the pain of it, he loosened his grasp, when she
jumped to the ground, made her escape and was seen no more.</p>
<p>What a pity that no one came to Kwai&rsquo;s rescue and so made sure
of the beast!</p>

<h2 class="main">CHEUNG PUK-CHANG, THE SEER</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Cheung Puk-chang.&mdash;The <i>Yol-ryok Keui-sul</i>,
one of Korea&rsquo;s noted histories, says of Cheung Puk-chang that he
was pure in purpose and without selfish ambition. He was superior to
all others in his marvellous gifts. For him to read a book once was to
know it by heart. There was nothing that he could not
understand&mdash;astronomy, geology, music, medicine, mathematics,
fortune-telling and Chinese characters, which he knew by intuition and
not from study.</p>
<p>He followed his father in the train of the envoy to Peking, and
there talked to all the strange peoples whom he met without any
preparation. They all wondered at him and called him &ldquo;The
Mystery.&rdquo; He knew, too, the meaning of the calls of birds and
beasts; and while he lived in the mountains he could see and tell what
people were doing in the distant valley, indicating what was going on
in each house, which, upon investigation, was found in each case to be
true. He was a Taoist, and received strange revelations. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e976" href="#xd25e976" name=
"xd25e976">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>While in Peking there met him envoys from the Court of Loochoo, who
also were prophets. While in their own country they had studied the
horoscope, and on going into China knew that they were to meet a Holy
Man. As they went on their way they asked concerning this mysterious
being, and at last reached Peking. Inquiring, they went from one
envoy&rsquo;s station to another till they met Cheung Puk-chang, when a
great fear came upon them, and they fell prostrate to the earth.</p>
<p>They took from their baggage a little book inscribed, &ldquo;In such
a year, on such a day, at such an hour, in such a place, you shall meet
a Holy Man.&rdquo; &ldquo;If this does not mean your Excellency,&rdquo;
said they, &ldquo;whom can it mean?&rdquo; They asked that he would
teach them the sacred Book of Changes, and he responded by teaching it
in their own language. At that time the various envoys, hearing of
this, contended with each other as to who should first see the
marvellous stranger, and he spoke to each in his own tongue. They all,
greatly amazed, said, &ldquo;He is indeed a man of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some one asked him, saying, &ldquo;There are those who understand
the sounds of birds and beasts, but foreign languages have to be
learned to be known; how can you speak them without study?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puk-chang replied, &ldquo;I do not know them from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e985" href="#xd25e985" name=
"xd25e985">43</a>]</span>having learned them, but know them
unconsciously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puk-chang was acquainted with the three religions, but he considered
Confucianism as the first. &ldquo;Its writings as handed down,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;teach us filial piety and reverence. The learning of
the Sages deals with relationships among men and not with spiritual
mysteries; but Taoism and Buddhism deal with the examination of the
soul and the heart, and so with things above and not with things on the
earth. This is the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At thirty-two years of age he matriculated, but had no interest in
further literary study. He became, instead, an official teacher of
medicine, astrology and mathematics.</p>
<p>He was a fine whistler, we are told, and once when he had climbed to
the highest peak of the Diamond Mountains and there whistled, the
echoes resounded through the hills, and the priests were startled and
wondered whose flute was playing.]</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>[There is a term in Korea which reads <i>he-an pang-kwang</i>,
&ldquo;spiritual-eye distant-vision,&rdquo; the seeing of things in the

it breathes. From this part of the head go forth five rays of light
that shoot out and up more and more as the student advances in the
spiritual way. As far as they extend so is the spiritual vision
perfected, until at last a Korean sufficiently advanced could sit and
say, &ldquo;In London, to-day, such and such a great affair is taking
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example, So Wha-tam, who was a Taoist Sage, once was seen to
laugh to himself as he sat with closed eyes, and when asked why he
laughed, said, &ldquo;Just now in the monastery of Ha-in [300 miles
distant] there is a great feast going on. The priest stirring the huge
kettle of bean gruel has tumbled in, but the others do not know this,
and are eating the soup.&rdquo; News came from the monastery later on
that proved that what the sage had seen was actually true.</p>
<p>The History of Confucius, too, deals with this when it tells of his
going with his disciple An-ja and looking off from the Tai Mountains of
Shan-tung toward the kingdom of On. Confucius asked An-ja if he could
see anything, and An-ja replied, &ldquo;I see white horses tied at the
gates of On.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Confucius said, &ldquo;No, no, your vision is imperfect, desist from
looking. They are not white horses, but are rolls of white silk hung
out for bleaching.&rdquo;] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1011"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Master, Puk-chang, was a noted Korean. From the
time of his birth he was a wonderful mystery. In reading a book, if he
but glanced through it, he could recall it word for word. Without any
special study he became a master of astronomy, geology, medicine,
fortune-telling, music, mathematics and geomancy, and so truly a
specialist was he that he knew them all.</p>
<p>He was thoroughly versed also in the three great religions,
Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. He talked constantly of what other
people could not possibly comprehend. He understood the sounds of the
birds, the voices of Nature, and much else. He accompanied his father
in his boyhood days when he went as envoy to Peking. At that time,
strange barbarian peoples used also to come and pay their tribute.
Puk-chang picked up acquaintance with them on the way. Hearing their
language but once, he was readily able to communicate with them. His
own countrymen who accompanied him were not the only ones astonished,
nor the Chinamen themselves, but the barbarians as well. There are
numerous interesting stories hinted at in the history of Puk-chang, but
few suitable records were made of them, and so many are lost.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1020" href="#xd25e1020" name=
"xd25e1020">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>There is one, however, that I recall that comes to me through
trustworthy witnesses: Puk-chang, on a certain day, went to visit his
paternal aunt. She asked him to be seated, and as they talked together,
said to him, &ldquo;I had some harvesting to do in Yong-nam County, and
sent a servant to see to it. His return is overdue and yet he does not
come. I am afraid he has fallen in with thieves, or chanced on a fire
or some other misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puk-chang replied, &ldquo;Shall I tell you how it goes with him, and
how far he has come on the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, saying, &ldquo;Do you mean to joke about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puk-chang, from where he was sitting, looked off apparently to the
far south, and at last said to his aunt, &ldquo;He is just now crossing
the hill called Bird Pass in Mun-kyong County, Kyong-sang Province.
Hallo! he is getting a beating just now from a passing <i>yangban</i>
(gentleman), but I see it is his own fault, so you need not trouble
about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aunt laughed, and asked, &ldquo;Why should he be beaten;
what&rsquo;s the reason, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puk-chang replied, &ldquo;It seems this official was eating his
dinner at the top of the hill when your servant rode by him without
dismounting. The gentleman was naturally very angry and had his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1036" href="#xd25e1036" name=
"xd25e1036">47</a>]</span>servants arrest your man, pull him from his
horse, and beat him over the face with their rough straw
shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The aunt could not believe it true, but treated the matter as a
joke; and yet Puk-chang did not seem to be joking.</p>
<p>Interested and curious, she made a note of the day on the wall after
Puk-chang had taken his departure, and when the servant returned, she
asked him what day he had come over Bird Pass, and it proved to be the
day recorded. She added also, &ldquo;Did you get into trouble with a
<i>yangban</i> there when you came by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant gave a startled look, and asked, &ldquo;How do you
know?&rdquo; He then told all that had happened to him, and it was just
as Puk-chang had given it even to the smallest detail.</p>

of over ninety. When he was young he loved archery, and went as
military attach&eacute; to the capital of the Mings (Nanking). There he
met a prophet who taught him the <i>Whang-jong Kyong</i>, or Sacred
Book of the Taoists, and thus he learned their laws and practised their
teachings. His life was written by Yi So-kwang.]</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>[Chon U-chi was a magician of Songdo who lived about 1550, and was
associated in his life with Shin Kwang-hu. At the latter&rsquo;s
residence one day when a friend called, Kwang-hu asked Chon to show
them one of his special feats. A little later they brought in a table
of rice for each of the party, and Chon took a mouthful of his, and
then blew it out toward the courtyard, when the rice changed into
beautiful butterflies that flew gaily away.</p>
<p>Chang O-sa used to tell a story of his father, who said that one day
Chon came to call upon him at his house and asked for a book entitled
<i>The Tu-si</i>, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1072" href=

it was his ghost. I gave him the book, though I did not learn till
afterwards that he had been dead for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>History of Famous Men</i> says, &ldquo;He was a man who
understood heretical magic, and other dangerous teachings by which he
deceived the people. He was arrested for this and locked up in prison

ordered by the prison authorities, and later, when his relatives came
to exhume his remains, they found that the coffin was empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Yun Se-Pyong was a military man who rose to the rank
of minister in the days of King Choong-jong. It seems that Yun learned
the doctrine of magic from a passing stranger, whom he met on his way
to Peking in company with the envoy. When <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1093" href="#xd25e1093" name="xd25e1093">50</a>]</span>at home he
lived in a separate house, quite apart from the other members of his
family. He was a man so greatly feared that even his wife and children
dared not approach him. What he did in secret no one seemed to know. In
winter he was seen to put iron cleats under each arm and to change them
frequently, and when they were put off they seemed to be red-hot.</p>
<p>At the same time there was a magician in Korea called Chon U-chi,
who used to go about Seoul plying his craft. So skilful was he that he
could even simulate the form of the master of a house and go freely
into the women&rsquo;s quarters. On this account he was greatly feared
and detested. Yun heard of him on more than one occasion, and
determined to rid the earth of him. Chon heard also of Yun and gave him
a wide berth, never appearing in his presence. He used frequently to
say, &ldquo;I am a magician only; Yun is a God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a certain day Chon informed his wife that Yun would come that
afternoon and try to kill him, &ldquo;and so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
shall change my shape in order to escape his clutches. If any one comes
asking for me just say that I am not at home.&rdquo; He then
metamorphosed himself into a beetle, and crawled under a crock that
stood overturned in the courtyard.</p>
<p>When evening began to fall a young woman <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1101" href="#xd25e1101" name=
"xd25e1101">51</a>]</span>came to Chon&rsquo;s house, a very beautiful
woman too, and asked, &ldquo;Is the master Chon at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife replied, &ldquo;He has just gone out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman laughingly said, &ldquo;Master Chon and I have been
special friend&rsquo;s for a long time, and I have an appointment with
him to-day. Please say to him that I have come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chon&rsquo;s wife, seeing a pretty woman come thus, and ask in such
a familiar way for her husband, flew into a rage and said, &ldquo;The
rascal has evidently a second wife that he has never told me of. What
he said just now is all false,&rdquo; so she went out in a fury, and
with a club smashed the crock. When the crock was broken there was the
beetle underneath it. Then the woman who had called suddenly changed
into a bee, and flew at and stung the beetle. Chon, metamorphosed into
his accustomed form, fell over and died, and the bee flew away.</p>
<p>Yun lived at his own house as usual, when suddenly he broke down one
day in a fit of tears. The members of his family in alarm asked the
reason.</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;My sister living in Chulla Province has just at
this moment died.&rdquo; He then called his servants, and had them
prepare funeral supplies, saying, &ldquo;They are poor where she lives,
and so I must help them.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1113" href="#xd25e1113" name="xd25e1113">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>He wrote a letter, and after sealing it, said to one of his
attendants, &ldquo;If you go just outside the gate you will meet a man
wearing a horsehair cap and a soldier&rsquo;s uniform. Call him in. He
is standing there ready to be summoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was called in, and sure enough he was a Kon-yun-no (servant of
the gods). He came in and at once prostrated himself before Yun. Yun
said, &ldquo;My sister has just now died in such a place in Chulla
Province. Take this letter and go at once. I shall expect you back
to-night with the answer. The matter is of such great importance that
if you do not bring it as I order, and within the time appointed, I
shall have you punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;I shall be in time, be not anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun then gave him the letter and the bundle, and he went outside the
main gateway and disappeared.</p>
<p>Before dark he returned with the answer. The letter read: &ldquo;She
died at such an hour to-day and we were in straits as to what to do,
when your letter came with the supplies, just as though we had seen
each other. Wonderful it is!&rdquo; The man who brought the answer
immediately went out and disappeared. The house of mourning is situated
over ten days&rsquo; journey from Seoul, but he returned ere sunset, in
the space of two or three hours.</p>

<p class="first">The former magistrate of Quelpart, Kim Su-ik, lived
inside of the South Gate of Seoul. When he was young it was his habit
to study Chinese daily until late at night. Once, when feeling hungry,
he called for his wife to bring him something to eat.</p>
<p>The wife replied, &ldquo;We have nothing in the house except seven
or eight chestnuts. Shall I roast these and bring them to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim replied, &ldquo;Good; bring them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servants were asleep, and there was no one on hand to answer a
call, so the wife went to the kitchen, made a fire and cooked them
herself. Kim waited, meanwhile, for her to come.</p>
<p>After a little while she brought them in a handbasket, cooked and
ready served for him. Kim ate and enjoyed them much. Meanwhile she sat
before his desk and waited. Suddenly the door opened, and another
person entered. Kim raised his eyes to see, and there was the exact
duplicate of his wife, with a basket in her hand and roasted chestnuts.
As he looked at both of them beneath the light the two women were
perfect facsimiles of each other. The two also looked back and forth in
alarm, saying, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this that&rsquo;s happened? Who are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim once again received the roasted nuts, laid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1162" href="#xd25e1162" name=

woman, the first one by the right hand and the second by the left,
holding fast till the break of day.</p>
<p>At last the cocks crew, and the east began to lighten. The one whose
right hand he held, said, &ldquo;Why do you hold me so? It hurts; let
me go.&rdquo; She shook and tugged, but Kim held all the tighter. In a
little, after struggling, she fell to the floor and suddenly changed
into a wild cat. Kim, in fear and surprise, let her go, and she made
her escape through the door. What a pity that he did not make the beast
fast for good and all!</p>

<p><i>Note by the writer.</i>&mdash;Foxes turning into women and
deceiving people is told of in <i>Kwang-keui</i> and other Chinese
novels, but the wild cat&rsquo;s transformation is more wonderful
still, and something that I have never heard of. By what law do
creatures like foxes and wild cats so change? I am unable to find any
law that governs it. Some say that the fox carries a magic charm by
which it does these magic things, but can this account for the wild
cat?</p>

<h2 class="main">THE ILL-FATED PRIEST</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A certain scribe of Chung-chong Province, whose name
was Kim Kyong-jin, once told me the following story. Said he: &ldquo;In
the year 1640, as I was journeying past Big Horn Bridge in Ta-in
County, I saw a scholar, who, with his four or five servants, had met
with some accident and all were reduced to a state of unconsciousness,
lying by the river side. I asked the reason for what had befallen them,
and they at last said in reply, &lsquo;We were eating our noon meal by
the side of the road, when a Buddhist priest came by, a proud, arrogant
fellow, who refused to bow or show any recognition of us. One of the
servants, indignant at this, shouted at him. The priest, however, beat
him with his stick, and when others went to help, he beat them also, so
that they were completely worsted and unable to rise or walk. He then
scolded the scholar, saying, &ldquo;You did not reprimand your servants
for their insult to me, so I&rsquo;ll have to take it out of you as
well.&rdquo; The Buddhist gave him a number of vicious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1187" href="#xd25e1187" name=
"xd25e1187">57</a>]</span>blows, so that he completely
collapsed;&rsquo; and when I looked there was the priest a <i>li</i> or
two ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just then a military man, aged about forty or so, came my
way. He was poor in flesh and seemed to have no strength. Riding a
cadaverous pony, he came shuffling along; a boy accompanying carried
his hat-cover and bow and arrows. He arrived at the stream, and, seeing
the people in their plight, asked the cause. The officer was very
angry, and said, &lsquo;Yonder impudent priest, endowed with no end of
brute force, has attacked my people and me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said the stranger, &lsquo;I have
been aware of him for a long time, and have decided to rid the earth of
him, but I have never had an opportunity before. Now that I have at
last come on him I am determined to have satisfaction.&rsquo; So he
dismounted from his horse, tightened his girth, took his bow, and an
arrow that had a &lsquo;fist&rsquo; head, and made off at a gallop
after the priest. Soon he overtook him. Just as the priest looked back
the archer let fly with his arrow, which entered deep into the chest.
He then dismounted, drew his sword, pierced the two hands of the priest
and passed a string through them, tied him to his horse&rsquo;s tail,
and came triumphantly back to where the scholar lay, and said,
&lsquo;Now do with this fellow as you please. I am going.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1196" href="#xd25e1196" name=

<p>&ldquo;The scholar bowed before the archer, thanked him, asked his
place of residence and name. He replied, &lsquo;My home is in the
County of Ko-chang,&rsquo; but he did not give his name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scholar looked at the priest, and never before had he
seen so powerful a giant, but now, with his chest shot through and his
hands pierced, he was unable to speak; so they arose, made mincemeat of
him, and went on their way rejoicing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">Yi Chi-Ham (Master To-jong).&mdash;A story is told of
him that on the day after his wedding he went out with his <i>topo</i>
or ceremonial coat on, but came back later without it. On inquiry being
made, it was found that he had torn it into pieces to serve as bandages
for a sick child that he had met with on his walk.</p>
<p>Once on a time he had an impression that his father-in-law&rsquo;s
home was shortly to be overtaken by a great disaster; he therefore took
his wife and disappeared from the place. In the year following, for
some political offence, the home was indeed wiped out and the family
wholly destroyed.</p>
<p>To-jong was not only a prophet, but also a magician, as was shown by
his handling of a boat. When he took to sea the waters lay quiet before
him, and all his path was peace. He would be absent sometimes for a
year or more, voyaging in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>He practised fasting, and would go sometimes for months without
eating. He also overcame <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1222" href=
"#xd25e1222" name="xd25e1222">60</a>]</span>thirst, and in the hot days
of summer would avoid drinking. He stifled all pain and suffering, so
that when he walked and his feet were blistered he paid no attention to
it.</p>
<p>While young he was a disciple of a famous Taoist, So Wha-dam. As his
follower he used to dress in grass cloth (the poor man&rsquo;s garb),
wear straw shoes and carry his bundle on his back. He would be on
familiar terms with Ministers of State, and yet show indifference to
their greatness and pomp. He was acquainted with the various magic
practices, so that in boating he used to hang out gourd cups at each
corner of the boat, and thus equipped he went many times to and from
Quelpart and never met a wind. He did merchandising, made money, and
bought land which yielded several thousand bags of rice that he
distributed among the poor.</p>
<p>He lived in Seoul in a little dug-out, so that his name became
&ldquo;Mud Pavilion,&rdquo; or To-jong. His cap was made of metal,
which he used to cook his food in, and which he then washed and put
back on his head again. He used also to wear wooden shoes and ride on a
pack saddle.</p>
<p>He built a house for the poor in Asan County when he was magistrate
there, gathered in all the needy and had them turn to and work at
whatever they had any skill in, so that they lived and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1230" href="#xd25e1230" name=
"xd25e1230">61</a>]</span>flourished. When any one had no special
ability, he had him weave straw shoes. He urged them on till they could
make as many as ten pairs a day.</p>
<p>Yul-gok said of him that he was a dreamer and not suitable for this
matter-of-fact world, because he belonged to the realm of flowers and
pretty birds, songs and sweet breezes, and not to the common clay of
corn and beef and radishes. To-jong heard this, and replied,
&ldquo;Though I am not of a kind equal to beans and corn, still I will
rank with acorns and chestnuts. Why am I wholly useless?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Teacher To-jong was once upon a time a merchant, and
in his merchandising went as far as the East Sea. One night he slept in
a fishing village on the shore. At that time another stranger called
who was said to be an <i>i-in</i> or &ldquo;holy man.&rdquo; The three
met and talked till late at night&mdash;the master of the house, the
&ldquo;holy man&rdquo; and To-jong. It was very clear and beautifully
calm. The &ldquo;holy man&rdquo; looked for a time out over the expanse
of water, then suddenly gave a great start of terror, and said,
&ldquo;An awful thing is about to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companions, alarmed at his manner, asked him what he meant. He
replied, &ldquo;In two hours or so there will be a tidal wave that will
engulf this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1250" href="#xd25e1250"
name="xd25e1250">62</a>]</span>whole village, utterly destroying
everything. If you do not make haste to escape all will be as fish in a
net.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-jong, being something of an astrologer himself, thought first to
solve the mystery of this, but could arrive at no explanation.</p>
<p>The owner of the house would not believe it, and refused to prepare
for escape.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;holy man&rdquo; said, however, &ldquo;Even though you do
not believe what I say, let us go for a little up the face of the rear
mountain. If my words fail we can only come down again, and no one will
be the worse for it. If you still do not wish to trust me, leave your
goods and furniture just as they are and let the people come
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-jong was greatly interested, though he could not understand it.
The master, too, could no longer refuse this proposal, so he took his
family and a few light things and followed the &ldquo;holy man&rdquo;
up the hill.</p>
<p>He had them ascend to the very top, &ldquo;in order,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-jong did not go to the top, but seated himself about half-way up.
He asked the &ldquo;holy man&rdquo; if he would not be safe enough
there.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;holy man&rdquo; replied, &ldquo;Others would never escape
if they remained where you are, but you will simply get a fright and
live through it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1266" href=

<p>When cock-crow came, sure enough the sea suddenly lifted its face,
overflowed its banks, and the waves came rolling up to the heavens,
climbing the mountain-sides till they touched the feet of To-jong. The
whole town on the seashore was engulfed. When daylight came the waters
receded.</p>
<p>To-jong bowed to the &ldquo;holy man&rdquo; and asked that he might
become his disciple. The &ldquo;holy man,&rdquo; however, disclaimed
any knowledge, saying that he had simply known it by accident. He was a
man who did not speak of his own attainments. To-jong asked for his
place of residence, which he indicated as near by, and then left. He
went to seek him on the following day, but the house was vacant, and
there was no one there.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE VISIT OF THE MAN OF GOD</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the thirty-third year of Mal-yok of the Mings
(<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1605), being the year <i>Eulsa</i> of the
reign of Son-jo, in the seventh moon, a great rain fell, such a rain as
had not been seen since the founding of the dynasty. Before that rain
came on, a man of Kang-won Province was cutting wood on the hill-side.
While thus engaged, an angel in golden armour, riding on a white horse
and carrying a spear, came down to him from heaven. His appearance was
most dazzling, and the woodman, looking at him, recognized him as a Man
of God. Also a Buddhist priest, carrying a staff, came down in his
train. The priest&rsquo;s appearance, too, was very remarkable.</p>
<p>The Man of God stopped his horse and seemed to be talking with the
priest, while the woodcutter, alarmed by the great sight, hid himself
among the trees.</p>
<p>The Man of God seemed to be very angry for some reason or other,
raised his spear, and, pointing to the four winds, said, &ldquo;I shall
flood all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1294" href=
"#xd25e1294" name="xd25e1294">65</a>]</span>earth from such a point to
such a point, and destroy the inhabitants thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priest following cried and prayed him to desist, saying,
&ldquo;This will mean utter destruction to mortals; please let thy
wrath rest on me.&rdquo; As he prayed thus earnestly the Man of God
again said, &ldquo;Then shall I limit it to such and such places. Will
that do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the priest prayed more earnestly still, till the Man replied
emphatically, &ldquo;I have lessened the punishment more than a half
already on your account; I can do no more.&rdquo; Though the priest
prayed still, the Man of God refused him, so that at last he
submissively said, &ldquo;Thy will be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ended thus and both departed, passing away through the upper
air into heaven.</p>
<p>The two had talked for a long time, but the distance being somewhat
great between them and the woodman, he did not hear distinctly all that
was said.</p>
<p>He went home, however, in great haste, and with his wife and family
made his escape, and from that day the rain began to fall. In it Mount
Otai collapsed, the earth beneath it sank until it became a vast lake,
all the inhabitants were destroyed, and the woodcutter alone made his
escape.</p>

<p class="first">[The calling of spirits is one of the powers supposed
to be possessed by disciples of the Old Philosopher (Taoists), who
reach a high state of spiritual attainment. While the natural desires
remain they cloud and obstruct spiritual vision; once rid of them, even
angels and immortal beings become unfolded to the sight. They say,
&ldquo;If once all the obstructions of the flesh are eliminated even
God can be seen.&rdquo; They also say, &ldquo;If I have no selfish
desire, the night around me will shine with golden light; and if all
injurious thoughts are truly put away, the wild deer of the mountain
will come down and play beside me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Story</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the year 1654 there was a man of letters living in
Imsil who claimed that he could control spirits, and that two demon
guards were constantly at his bidding. One day he was sitting with a
friend playing chess, when they agreed that the loser in each case was
to pay a fine in drink. The friend lost and yet refused to pay his
wager, so that the master said, &ldquo;If you do not pay up I&rsquo;ll
make it hot for you.&rdquo; The man, however, refused, till at last the
master, exasperated, turned his back upon him and called out suddenly
into the upper air some formula or other, as if he were giving a
command. The man dashed off through the courtyard to make his escape,
but an unseen hand bared his body, and administered to him such a set
of sounding blows that they left blue, seamy marks. Unable to bear the
pain of it longer, he yielded, and then the master laughed and let him
go.</p>
<p>At another time he was seated with a friend, while in the adjoining
village a witch <i>koot</i> (exorcising ceremony) was in progress, with
drums and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1333" href="#xd25e1333"
name="xd25e1333">68</a>]</span>gongs banging furiously. The master
suddenly rushed out to the bamboo grove that stood behind the official
<i>yamen</i>, and, looking very angry and with glaring eyes, he
shouted, and made bare his arm as if to drive off the furies. After a
time he ceased. The friend, thinking this a peculiar performance, asked
what it meant. His reply was, &ldquo;A crowd of devils have come from
the <i>koot</i>, and are congregating in the grove of bamboos; if I do
not drive them off trouble will follow in the town, and for that cause
I shouted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he was making a journey with a certain friend, when suddenly,
on the way, he called out to the mid-air, saying, &ldquo;Let her go,
let her go, I say, or I&rsquo;ll have you punished severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His appearance was so peculiar and threatening that the friend asked
the cause. For the time being he gave no answer, and they simply went
on their way.</p>
<p>That night they entered a village where they wished to sleep, but
the owner of the house where they applied said that they had sickness,
and asked them to go. They insisted, however, till he at last sent a
servant to drive them off. Meanwhile the womenfolk watched the affair
through the chinks of the window, and they talked in startled whispers,
so that the scholar overheard them.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the man of the house followed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1349" href="#xd25e1349" name=
"xd25e1349">69</a>]</span>in the most humble and abject manner, asking
them to return and accept entertainment and lodging at his house. Said
he, &ldquo;I have a daughter, sir, and she fell ill this very day and
died, and after some time came to life again. Said she, &lsquo;A devil
caught me and carried my soul off down the main roadway, where we met a
man, who stopped us, and in fierce tones drove off the spirit, who let
me go, and so I returned to life.&rsquo; She looked out on your
Excellency through the chink of the window, and, behold, you are the
man. I am at my wits&rsquo; end to know what to say to you. Are you a
genii or are you a Buddhist, so marvellously to bring back the dead to
life? I offer this small refreshment; please accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scholar laughed, and said, &ldquo;Nonsense! Just a woman&rsquo;s
haverings. How could I do such things?&rdquo; He lived for seven or
eight years more, and died.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a soldier once of Kang-wha who was the chief
man of his village; a low-class man, he was, apparently, without any
gifts. One day his wife, overcome by a fit of jealousy, sat sewing in
her inner room. It was midwinter, and he was obliged to be at home; so,
with intent to cheer her up and take her mind off the blues, he said to
her, &ldquo;Would you like to see me make some butterflies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife, more angry than ever at this, rated him for his impudence,
and paid no further attention.</p>
<p>The soldier then took her workbasket and from it selected bits of
silk of various colours, tucked <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1378" href="#xd25e1378" name="xd25e1378">71</a>]</span>them into
his palm, closed his hand upon them, and repeated a prayer, after which
he threw the handful into the air. Immediately beautiful butterflies
filled the room, dazzling the eyes and shining in all the colours of
the silk itself.</p>
<p>The wife, mystified by the wonder of it, forgot her anger. The
soldier a little later opened his hand, held it up, and they all flew
into it. He closed it tight and then again opened his hand, and they
were pieces of silk only. His wife alone saw this; it was unknown to
others. No such strange magic was ever heard of before.</p>
<p>In 1637, when Kang-wha fell before the Manchus, all the people of
the place fled crying for their lives, while the soldier remained
undisturbed at his home, eating his meals with his wife and family just
as usual. He laughed at the neighbours hurrying by. Said he, &ldquo;The
barbarians will not touch this town; why do you run so?&rdquo; Thus it
turned out that, while the whole island was devastated, the
soldier&rsquo;s village escaped.</p>

<p class="first">The old family seat of Prince Ha Yun was in the County
of Keum-chon. He was a famous Minister of State in the days of peace
and prosperity, and used frequently to find rest and leisure in his
summer-house in this same county. It was a large and well-ordered
mansion, and was occupied by his children for many years after his
death.</p>
<p>The people of that county used to tell a very strange story of Ha
and his prosperity, which runs thus: He had placed in an upper room a
large crock that was used to hold flour. One day one of the servants,
wishing to get some flour from the jar, lifted the lid, when suddenly
from the depths of it a huge snake made its appearance. The servant,
startled, fell back in great alarm, and then went and told the master
what had happened. The master sent his men-slaves and had the jar
brought down. They broke it open and let out a huge, awful-looking
snake, such as one had never seen <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Several of the servants joined in with clubs and killed the brute. They
then piled wood on it and set fire to the whole. Vile fumes arose that
filled the house. From the fumes all the people of the place died,
leaving no one behind to represent the family. Others who entered the
house died also, so that the place became cursed, and was left in
desolation. A little later a mysterious fire broke out and burnt up the
remaining buildings, leaving only the vacant site. To this day the

<h2 class="main">THE MAN ON THE ROAD</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Manchu War of 1636, the people of Seoul rushed
off in crowds to make their escape. One party of them came suddenly
upon a great force of the enemy, armed and mounted. The hills and
valleys seemed full of them, and there was no possible way of escape.
What to do they knew not. In the midst of their perplexity they
suddenly saw some one sitting peacefully in the main roadway just in
front, underneath a pine tree, quite unconcerned. He had dismounted
from his horse, which a servant held, standing close by. A screen of
several yards of cotton cloth was hanging up just before him, as if to
shield him from the dust of the passing army.</p>
<p>The people who were making their escape came up to this stranger,
and said imploringly, &ldquo;We are all doomed to die. What shall we
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mysterious stranger said, &ldquo;Why should you die? and why are
you so frightened? Sit down by me and see the barbarians go by.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1427" href="#xd25e1427" name=
"xd25e1427">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>The people, perceiving his mind so composed and his appearance
devoid of fear, and they having no way of escape, did as he bade them
and sat down.</p>
<p>The cavalry of the enemy moved by in great numbers, killing every
one they met, not a single person escaping; but when they reached the
place where the magician sat, they went by without, apparently, seeing
anything. Thus they continued till the evening, when all had passed by.
The stranger and the people with him sat the day through without any
harm overtaking them, even though they were in the midst of the
enemy&rsquo;s camp, as it were.</p>
<p>At last awaking to the fact that he was possessor of some wonderful
magic, they all with one accord came and bowed before him, asking his
name and his place of residence. He made no answer, however, but
mounted his beautiful horse and rode swiftly away, no one being able to
overtake him.</p>
<p>The day following the party fell in with a man who had been captured
but had made his escape. They asked if he had seen anything special the
day before. He said, &ldquo;When I followed the barbarian army, passing
such and such a point&rdquo;&mdash;indicating the place where the
magician had sat with the people&mdash;&ldquo;we skirted great walls
and precipitous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1436" href=

<p class="first">Some years ago a noted official became the magistrate
of Ko-song County. On a certain day a guest called on him to pay his
respects, and when noon came the magistrate had a table of food
prepared for him, on which was a dish of skate soup. When the guest saw
the soup he twisted his features and refused it, saying, &ldquo;To-day
I am fasting from meat, and so beg to be excused.&rdquo; His face grew
very pale, and tears flowed from his eyes. The magistrate thought this
behaviour strange, and asked him two or three times the meaning of it.
When he could no longer withhold a reply, he went into all the
particulars and told him the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your humble servant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has in his life
met with much unheard-of and unhappy experience, which he has never
told to a living soul, but now that your Excellency asks it of me, I
cannot refrain from telling. Your servant&rsquo;s father was a very old
man, nearly a hundred, when one day he was taken down with a high
fever, in which his body was like a fiery furnace. Seeing the danger he
was in, his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1454" href="#xd25e1454"
name="xd25e1454">79</a>]</span>children gathered about weeping,
thinking that the time of his departure had surely come. But he lived,
and a few days later said to us, &lsquo;I am burdened with so great a
heat in this sickness that I am not able to endure it longer. I would
like to go out to the bank of the river that runs before the house and
see the water flowing by, and be refreshed by it. Do not disobey me
now, but carry me out at once to the water&rsquo;s edge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We remonstrated with him and begged him not to do so, but he
grew very angry, and said, &lsquo;If you do not as I command, you will
be the death of me&rsquo;; and so, seeing that there was no help for
it, we bore him out and placed him on the bank of the river. He, seeing
the water, was greatly delighted, and said, &lsquo;The clear flowing
water cures my sickness.&rsquo; A moment later he said further,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to be quite alone and rid of you all for a
little. Go away into the wood and wait till I tell you to
come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We again remonstrated about this, but he grew furiously
angry, so that we were helpless. We feared that if we insisted, his
sickness would grow worse, and so we were compelled to yield. We went a
short distance away and then turned to look, when suddenly the old
father was gone from the place where he had been seated. We hurried
back to see what had happened. My father had taken <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1460" href="#xd25e1460" name=
"xd25e1460">80</a>]</span>off his clothes and plunged into the water,
which was muddied. His body was already half metamorphosed into a
skate. We saw its transformation in terror, and did not dare to go near
him, when all at once it became changed into a great flatfish, that
swam and plunged and disported itself in the water with intense
delight. He looked back at us as though he could hardly bear to go, but
a moment later he was off, entered the deep sea, and did not again
appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the edge of the stream where he had changed his form we
found his finger-nails and a tooth. These we buried, and to-day as a
family we all abstain from skate fish, and when we see the neighbours
frying or eating it we are overcome with disgust and horror.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a geomancer once, Yi Eui-sin, who in seeking
out a special mountain vein, started with the Dragon Ridge in North
Ham-kyong Province, and traced it as far as Pine Mountain in Yang-ju
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1484" href="#xd25e1484" name=
"xd25e1484">82</a>]</span>County, where it stopped in a beautifully
rounded end, forming a perfect site for burial. After wandering all day
in the hills, Yi&rsquo;s hungry spirit cried out for food. He saw
beneath the hill a small house, to which he went, and rapping at the
door asked for something to eat. A mourner, recently bereaved, came out
in a respectful and kindly way, and gave him a dish of white gruel. Yi,
after he had eaten, asked what time the friend had become a mourner,
and if he had already passed the funeral. The owner answered, &ldquo;I
am just now entering upon full mourning, but we have not yet arranged
for the funeral.&rdquo; He spoke in a sad and disheartened way.</p>
<p>Yi felt sorry for him, and asked the reason. &ldquo;I wonder if
it&rsquo;s because you are poor that you have not yet made the
necessary arrangements, or perhaps you have not yet found a suitable
site! I am an expert in reading the hills, and I&rsquo;ll tell you of a
site; would you care to see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mourner thanked him most gratefully, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be delighted to know of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yi then showed him the end of the great vein that he had just
discovered, also the spot for the grave and how to place its compass
points. &ldquo;After possessing this site,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you
will be greatly enriched, but in ten years you will have cause to
arrange for another site. When that comes to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1492" href="#xd25e1492" name=
"xd25e1492">83</a>]</span>pass please call me, won&rsquo;t you? In
calling for me just ask for Yi So-pang, who lives in West School Ward,
Seoul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mourner did as directed, and as the geomancer had foretold, all
his affairs prospered. He built a large tiled house, and ornamented the
grave with great stones as a prosperous and high-minded country
gentleman should do.</p>
<p>After ten years a guest called one day, and saluting him asked,
&ldquo;Is that grave yonder, beyond the stream, yours?&rdquo; The
master answered, &ldquo;It is mine.&rdquo; Then the stranger said,
&ldquo;That is a famous site, but ten years have passed since you have
come into possession of it, and the luck is gone; why do you not make a
change? If you wait too long you will rue it and may meet with great
disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owner, hearing this, thought of Yi the geomancer, and what he
had said years before. Remembering that, he asked the stranger to
remain as his guest while he went next day to Seoul to look up Yi in
West School Ward. He found him, and told him why he had come.</p>
<p>Yi said, &ldquo;I already knew of this.&rdquo; So the two journeyed
together to the inquirer&rsquo;s home. When there, they went with the
guest up the hill. Yi asked of the guest, &ldquo;Why did you tell the
master to change the site?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guest replied, &ldquo;This hill is a Kneeling <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1504" href="#xd25e1504" name=

too long it cannot endure it, so that within a limited time it must
fly. Ten years is the time; that&rsquo;s why I spoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yi laughed and said, &ldquo;Your idea is only a partial view, you
have thought of only one thing, there are other conditions that
enter.&rdquo; Then he showed the peak to the rear, and said,
&ldquo;Yonder is Dog Hill,&rdquo; and then one below,
&ldquo;which,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is Falcon Hill,&rdquo; and then
the stream in front, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is Cat River.
This is the whole group, the dog behind, the falcon just above, and the
cat in front, how then can the pheasant fly? It dares not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guest replied, &ldquo;Teacher, surely your eyes are enlightened,
and see further than those of ordinary men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From that day forth the Yis of Pine Hill became a great and noted
family.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE MAN WHO BECAME A PIG</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Kim Yu was the son of a country magistrate who
graduated with literary honours in 1596. In 1623 he was one of the
faithful courtiers who joined forces to dethrone the wicked Prince
Kwang-hai, and place In-jo on the throne. He was raised to the rank of
Prince and became, later, Prime Minister. In the year 1624, when Yi
Kwal raised an insurrection, he was the means of putting it down and of
bringing many of his followers to justice. In 1648, he died at the age
of seventy-seven.</p>
<p>In the last year of Son-jo the King called his grandchildren
together and had them write Chinese for him and draw pictures. At that
time In-jo was a little boy, and he drew a picture of a horse. King
Son-jo gave the picture to Yi Hang-bok, but when the latter some years
later went into exile he gave the picture to Kim Yu. Kim Yu took it,
and hung it up in his house and there it remained.</p>
<p>Prince In-jo was one day making a journey out of the Palace when he
was overtaken by rain, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1529"
href="#xd25e1529" name="xd25e1529">86</a>]</span>took refuge in a
neighbouring gate-quarters. A servant-maid came out and invited him in,
asking him not to stand in the wet, but Prince In-jo declined. The
invitation, however, was insisted on, and he went into the guest-room,
where he saw the picture of a horse on the wall. On examining it
carefully he recognized it as the picture he had drawn when a lad, and
he wondered how it could have come here. Kim Yu then came in and they
met for the first time. Prince In-jo told him how he had been overtaken
by rain and invited in. He asked concerning the picture of the horse
that hung on the wall, and Kim Yu in reply asked why he inquired.
Prince In-jo said, &ldquo;I drew that picture myself when I was a
boy.&rdquo; Just as they spoke together a rich table of food was
brought in from the inner quarters. Kim Yu, not knowing yet who his
guest was, looked with wonder at this surprise, and after Prince In-jo
had gone, he inquired of his wife why she had sent such delicious fare
in to a stranger. The wife replied, &ldquo;In a dream last night, I saw
the King come and stand in front of our house. I was just thinking it
over when the servant came in and said that some one was standing
before the door. I looked out, and lo, it was the man I had seen in my
dream! so I have treated him to the best of hospitality that I was
able.&rdquo; Kim Yu soon learned who his caller had been, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1531" href="#xd25e1531" name=
"xd25e1531">87</a>]</span>became from that time the faithful supporter
of Prince In-jo, and later helped to put him on the throne.</p>
<p>After In-jo became king he asked privately of Kim Yu where he had
got the picture. Kim Yu said, &ldquo;I got it from Prince Yi
Hang-bok.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kim Yu then called Yi&rsquo;s son and inquired of him as to how his
father had got it. The son said, &ldquo;In the last year of King Son-jo
he called my father along with all his grandchildren, and showed him
the writings and drawings of the young princes. My father looked at
them with interest, but the King gave him only one as a keepsake,
namely, the drawing of the horse.&rdquo; In the picture there was a
willow tree and a horse tied to it. Kim Yu then recognized the thought
that underlay the gift of the picture, namely, that Prince Yi Hang-bok
should support In-jo in the succession to the throne.]</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Story</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A certain Minister of State, called Kim Yu, living in
the County of Seung-pyong, had a relative who resided in a far-distant
part of the country, an old man aged nearly one hundred. On a certain
day a son of this patriarch came to the office of the Minister and
asked to see him. Kim ordered him to be admitted, and inquired as to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1543" href="#xd25e1543" name=
"xd25e1543">88</a>]</span>why he had come. Said he, &ldquo;I have
something very important to say, a private matter to lay before your
Excellency. There are so many guests with you now that I&rsquo;ll come
again in the evening and tell it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening, when all had departed, he came, and the Minister
ordered out his personal retainers and asked the meaning of the call.
The man replied, saying, &ldquo;My father, though very old, was, as you
perhaps know, a strong and hearty man. On a certain day he called us
children to him and said, &lsquo;I wish to have a siesta, so now close
the door and all of you go out of the room. Do not let any one venture
in till I call you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We children agreed, of course, and did so. Till late at night
there was neither call nor command to open the door, so that we began
to be anxious. We at last looked through the chink, and lo, there was
our father changed into a huge pig! Terrified by the sight of it we
opened the door and looked in, when the animal grunted and growled and
made a rush to get out past us. We hurriedly closed the door again and
held a consultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s keep the pig just as it is,
within doors, and care for it.&rsquo; Some said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s
have a funeral and bury it.&rsquo; We ignorant country-folk not knowing
just what to do under such peculiar circumstances, I have come to ask
counsel of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1551" href="#xd25e1551"
name="xd25e1551">89</a>]</span>your Excellency. Please think over this
startling phenomenon and tell us what we ought to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince Kim, hearing this, gave a great start, thought it over for a
long time, and at last said, &ldquo;No such mysterious thing was ever
heard of before, and I really don&rsquo;t know what is best to do under
the circumstances, but still, it seems to me that since this
metamorphosis has come about, you had better not bury it before death,
so give up the funeral idea. Since, too, it is not a human being any
longer, I do not think it right to keep it in the house. You say that
it wants to make its escape, and as a cave in the woods or hills is its
proper abode, I think you had better take it out and let it go free
into the trackless depths of some mountainous country, where no foot of
man has ever trod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The son accepted this wise counsel, and did as the Minister advised,
took it away into the deep mountains and let it go. Then he donned
sackcloth, mourned, buried his father&rsquo;s clothes for a funeral,
and observed the day of metamorphosis as the day of sacrificial
ceremony.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE OLD WOMAN WHO BECAME A GOBLIN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a Confucian scholar once who lived in the
southern part of Seoul. It is said that he went out for a walk one day
while his wife remained alone at home. When he was absent there came by
begging an old woman who looked like a Buddhist priestess, for while
very old her face was not wrinkled. The scholar&rsquo;s wife asked her
if she knew how to sew. She said she did, and so the wife made this
proposition, &ldquo;If you will stay and work for me I&rsquo;ll give
you your breakfast and your supper, and you&rsquo;ll not have to beg
anywhere; will you agree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied, &ldquo;Oh, thank you so much, I&rsquo;ll be
delighted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scholar&rsquo;s wife, well satisfied with her bargain, took her
in and set her to picking cotton, and making and spinning thread. In
one day she did more than eight ordinary women, and yet had, seemingly,
plenty of time to spare. The wife, delighted above measure, treated her
to a great feast. After five or six days, however, the feeling
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1573" href="#xd25e1573" name=
"xd25e1573">91</a>]</span>of delight and the desire to treat her
liberally and well wore off somewhat, so that the old woman grew angry
and said, &ldquo;I am tired of living alone, and so I want your husband
for my partner.&rdquo; This being refused, she went off in a rage, but
came back in a little accompanied by a decrepit old man who looked like
a Buddhist beggar.</p>
<p>These two came boldly into the room and took possession, cleared out
the things that were in the ancient tablet-box on the wall-shelf, and
both disappeared into it, so that they were not seen at all, but only
their voices heard. According to the whim that took them they now
ordered eatables and other things. When the scholar&rsquo;s wife failed
in the least particular to please them, they sent plague and sickness
after her, so that her children fell sick and died. Relatives on
hearing of this came to see, but they also caught the plague, fell ill
and died. Little by little no one dared come near the place, and it
became known at last that the wife was held as a prisoner by these two
goblin creatures. For a time smoke was seen by the town-folk coming out
of the chimney daily, and they knew that the wife still lived, but
after five or six days the smoke ceased, and they knew then that the
woman&rsquo;s end had come. No one dared even to make inquiry.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is often told that in the days of the Koryo Dynasty
(<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 918&ndash;1392), when an examination was
to be held, a certain scholar came from a far-distant part of the
country to take part. Once on his journey the day was drawing to a
close, and he found himself among the mountains. Suddenly he heard a
sneezing from among the creepers and bushes by the roadside, but could
see no one. Thinking it strange, he dismounted from his horse, went
into the brake and listened. He heard it again, and it seemed to come
from the roots of the creeper close beside him, so he ordered his
servant to dig round it and see. He dug and found a dead man&rsquo;s
skull. It was full of earth, and the roots of the creeper had passed
through the nostrils. The sneezing was caused by the annoyance felt by
the spirit from having the nose so discommoded.</p>
<p>The candidate felt sorry, washed the skull in clean water, wrapped
it in paper and reburied it in its former place on the hill-side. He
also brought a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1594" href=
"#xd25e1594" name="xd25e1594">93</a>]</span>table of food and offered
sacrifice, and said a prayer.</p>
<p>That night, in a dream, a scholar came to him, an old man with white
hair, who bowed, thanked him, and said, &ldquo;On account of sin
committed in a former life, I died out of season before I had fulfilled
my days. My posterity, too, were all destroyed, my body crumbled back
into the dust, my skull alone remaining, and that is what you found
below the creeper. On account of the root passing through it the
annoyance was great, and I could not help but sneeze. By good luck you
and your kind heart, blessed of Heaven, took pity on me, buried me in a
clean place and gave me food. Your kindness is greater than the
mountains, and like the blessing that first brought me into life.
Though my soul is by no means perfect, yet I long for some way by which
to requite your favour, and so I have exercised my powers in your
behalf. Your present journey is for the purpose of trying the official
Examination, so I shall tell you beforehand what the form is to be, and
the subject. It is to be of character groups of fives, in couplets; the
rhyme sound is &lsquo;pong,&rsquo; and the subject &lsquo;Peaks and
Spires of the Summer Clouds.&rsquo; I have already composed one for
you, which, if you care to use it, will undoubtedly win you the first
place. It is this&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1598" href=

departure.</p>
<p>The man, in wonder, awakened from his dream, came up to Seoul; and

been given him, and became first in the honours of the occasion.</p>

tiger, who used to accompany him as a dog does his master. One evening,
when he started off into the hills, he heard the distant tramp of the
great beast, who had got scent of his going, and had come rushing after
him. When Han saw him he turned, and said, &ldquo;Good old chap, you
come all this distance to be my friend; I love you for it.&rdquo; The
tiger prostrated himself and nodded with his head several times. He
used to accompany Han all through the nights, but when the day dawned
he would leave him.</p>
<p>Han later fell into bad company, grew fond of drink, and was one of
the boisterous companions of King Se-jo.]</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><i>The Story</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Han Myong-hoi was a renowned Minister of the Reign of
Se-jo (<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1455&ndash;1468). The King
appreciated and enjoyed him greatly, and there was no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1646" href="#xd25e1646" name=
"xd25e1646">96</a>]</span>one of the Court who could surpass him for
influence and royal favour. Confident in his position, Han did as he
pleased, wielding absolute power. At that time, like grass before the
wind, the world bowed at his coming; no one dared utter a word of
remonstrance.</p>
<p>When Han went as governor to Pyong-an Province he did all manner of
lawless things. Any one daring to cross his wishes in the least was
dealt with by torture and death. The whole Province feared him as they
would a tiger.</p>
<p>On a certain day Governor Han, hearing that the Deputy Prefect of
Son-chon had a very beautiful daughter, called the Deputy, and said,
&ldquo;I hear that you have a very beautiful daughter, whom I would
like to make my concubine. When I am on my official rounds shortly, I
shall expect to stop at your town and take her. So be ready for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Deputy, alarmed, said, &ldquo;How can your Excellency say that
your servant&rsquo;s contemptible daughter is beautiful? Some one has
reported her wrongly. But since you so command, how can I do but accede
gladly?&rdquo; So he bowed, said his farewell, and went home.</p>
<p>On his return his family noticed that his face was clouded with
anxiety, and the daughter asked why it was. &ldquo;Did the Governor
call you, father?&rdquo; asked she; &ldquo;and why are you so anxious?
Tell <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1656" href="#xd25e1656" name=
"xd25e1656">97</a>]</span>me, please.&rdquo; At first, fearing that she
would be disturbed, he did not reply, but her repeated questions forced
him, so that he said, &ldquo;I am in trouble on your account,&rdquo;
and then told of how the Governor wanted her for his concubine.
&ldquo;If I had refused I would have been killed, so I yielded; but a
gentleman&rsquo;s daughter being made a concubine is a disgrace unheard
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daughter made light of it and laughed. &ldquo;Why did you not
think it out better than that, father? Why should a grown man lose his
life for the sake of a girl? Let the daughter go. By losing one
daughter and saving your life, you surely do better than saving your
daughter and losing your life. One can easily see where the greater
advantage lies. A daughter does not count; give her over, that&rsquo;s
all. Don&rsquo;t for a moment think otherwise, just put away your
distress and anxiety. We women, every one of us, are under the ban, and
such things are decreed by Fate. I shall accept without any opposition,
so please have no anxiety. It is settled now, and you, father, must
yield and follow. If you do so all will be well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The father sighed, and said in reply, &ldquo;Since you seem so
willing, my mind is somewhat relieved.&rdquo; But from this time on the
whole house was in distress. The girl alone seemed perfectly unmoved,
not showing the slightest sign of fear. She <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1662" href="#xd25e1662" name=
"xd25e1662">98</a>]</span>laughed as usual, her light and happy laugh,
and her actions seemed wonderfully free.</p>
<p>In a little the Governor reached Son-chon on his rounds. He then
called the Deputy, and said, &ldquo;Make ready your daughter for
to-morrow and all the things needed.&rdquo; The Deputy came home and
made preparation for the so-called wedding. The daughter said,
&ldquo;This is not a real wedding; it is only the taking of a
concubine, but still, make everything ready in the way of refreshments
and ceremony as for a real marriage.&rdquo; So the father did as she
requested.</p>
<p>On the day following the Governor came to the house of the Deputy.
He was not dressed in his official robes, but came simply in the dress
and hat of a commoner. When he went into the inner quarters he met the
daughter; she stood straight before him. Her two hands were lifted in
ceremonial form, but instead of holding a fan to hide her face she held
a sword before her. She was very pretty. He gave a great start of
surprise, and asked the meaning of the knife that she held. She ordered
her nurse to reply, who said, &ldquo;Even though I am an obscure
countrywoman, I do not forget that I am born of the gentry; and though
your Excellency is a high Minister of State, still to take me by force
is an unheard-of dishonour. If you take me as your real and true wife
I&rsquo;ll serve you <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1668" href=
"#xd25e1668" name="xd25e1668">99</a>]</span>with all my heart, but if
you are determined to take me as a concubine I shall die now by this
sword. For that reason I hold it. My life rests on one word from your
Excellency. Speak it, please, before I decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor, though a man who observed no ceremony and never
brooked a question, when he saw how beautiful and how determined this
maiden was, fell a victim to her at once, and said, &ldquo;If you so
decide, then, of course, I&rsquo;ll make you my real wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her answer was, &ldquo;If you truly mean it, then please withdraw
and write out the certificate; send the gifts; provide the goose; dress
in the proper way; come, and let us go through the required ceremony;
drink the pledge-glass, and wed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor did as she suggested, carried out the forms to the
letter, and they were married.</p>
<p>She was not only a very pretty woman, but upright and true of
soul&mdash;a rare person indeed. The Governor took her home, loved her
and held her dear. He had, however, a real wife before and concubines,
but he set them all aside and fixed his affections on this one only.
She remonstrated with him over his wrongs and unrighteous acts, and he
listened and made improvement. The world took note of it, and praised
her as a true and wonderful woman. She counted herself the real wife,
but the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1679" href="#xd25e1679"
name="xd25e1679">100</a>]</span>first wife treated her as a concubine,
and all the relatives said likewise that she could never be considered
a real wife. At that time King Se-jo frequently, in the dress of a
commoner, used to visit Han&rsquo;s house. Han entertained him royally
with refreshments, which his wife used to bring and offer before him.
He called her his &ldquo;little sister.&rdquo; On a certain day King
Se-jo, as he was accustomed, came to the house, and while he was
drinking he suddenly saw the woman fall on her face before him. The
King in surprise inquired as to what she could possibly mean by such an
act. She then told all the story of her being taken by force and
brought to Seoul. She wept while she said, &ldquo;Though I am from a
far-distant part of the country I am of the gentry by ancestry, and my
husband took me with all the required ceremonies of a wife, so that I
ought not to be counted a concubine. But there is no law in this land
by which a second real wife may be taken after a first real wife
exists, so they call me a concubine, a matter of deepest disgrace.
Please, your Majesty, take pity on me and decide my case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King laughed, and said, &ldquo;This is a simple matter to
settle; why should my little sister make so great an affair of it, and
bow before me? I will decide your case at once. Come.&rdquo; He then
wrote out with his own hand a document making her a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1683" href="#xd25e1683" name=
"xd25e1683">101</a>]</span>real wife, and her children eligible for the
highest office. He wrote it, signed it, stamped it and gave it to
her.</p>
<p>From that time on she was known as a real wife, in rank and standing
equal to the first one. No further word was ever slightingly spoken,
and her children shared in the affairs of State.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the last year of Yon-san terrible evils were abroad
among the people. Such wickedness as the world had never seen before
was perpetrated, of which his Majesty was the evil genius. He even gave
orders to his eunuchs and underlings to bring to him any women of
special beauty that they might see in the homes of the highest
nobility, and whoever pleased him he used as his own. &ldquo;Never mind
objections,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take them by force and come.&rdquo;
Such were his orders. No one escaped him. He even went so far as to
publish abroad that Minister So and So&rsquo;s wife preferred him to
her husband and would like to live always in the Palace. It was the
common talk of the city, and people were dumbfounded.</p>
<p>For that reason all hearts forsook him, and because of this he was
dethroned, and King Choong-jong reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>In these days of trouble there was a young wife of a certain
minister, who was very beautiful in form and face. One day it fell
about that she was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1703" href=
"#xd25e1703" name="xd25e1703">103</a>]</span>ordered into the Palace.
Other women, when called, would cry and behave as though their lives
were forfeited, but this young woman showed not the slightest sign of
fear. She dressed and went straight into the Palace. King Yon-san saw
her, and ordered her to come close to him. She came, and then in a
sudden manner the most terrible odour imaginable was noticeable. The
King held his fan before his face, turned aside, spat, and said,
&ldquo;Dear me, I cannot stand this one, take her away,&rdquo; and so
she escaped undefiled.</p>
<p>How it came about was thus: She knew that she was likely to be
called at any moment, and so had planned a ruse by which to escape. Two
slices of meat she had kept constantly on hand, decayed and
foul-smelling, but always ready. She placed these under her arms as she
dressed and went into the Palace, and so provided this awful and
unaccountable odour.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE BOXED-UP GOVERNOR</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A certain literary official was at one time Governor
of the city of Kyong-ju. Whenever he visited the Mayor of the place, it
was his custom, on seeing dancing-girls, to tap them on the head with
his pipe, and say, &ldquo;These girls are devils, ogres, goblins. How
can you tolerate them in your presence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Naturally, those who heard this disliked him, and the Mayor himself
detested his behaviour and manners. He sent a secret message to the
dancing-girls, saying, &ldquo;If any of you, by any means whatever, can
deceive this governor, and put him to shame, I&rsquo;ll reward you
richly.&rdquo; Among them there was one girl, a mere child, who said
she could.</p>
<p>The Governor resided in the quarter of the city where the Confucian
Temple was, and he had but one servant with him, a young lad. The
dancing-girl who had decided to ensnare him, in the dress of a common
woman of the town, used frequently to go by the main gateway of the
Temple, and in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1725" href=
"#xd25e1725" name="xd25e1725">105</a>]</span>going would call the
Governor&rsquo;s boy to her. Sometimes she showed her profile and
sometimes she showed her whole form, as she stood in the gateway. The
boy would go out to her and she would speak to him for a moment or two
and then go. She came sometimes once a day, sometimes twice, and this
she kept up for a long time. The Governor at last inquired of the boy
as to who this woman was that came so frequently to call him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my sister,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;Her husband
went away on a peddling round a year or so ago, and has not yet
returned; consequently she has no one else to help her, so she
frequently calls and confers with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One evening, when the boy had gone to eat his meal and the Governor
was alone, the woman came to the main gateway, and called for the
boy.</p>
<p>His Excellency answered for him, and invited her in. When she came,
she blushed, and appeared very diffident, standing modestly aside.</p>
<p>The Governor said, &ldquo;My boy is absent just now, but I want a
smoke; go and get a light for my pipe, will you, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She brought the light, and then he said, &ldquo;Sit down too, and
smoke a little, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied, &ldquo;How could I dare do such a thing?&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1739" href="#xd25e1739" name=
"xd25e1739">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;There is no one else here now; never
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There being no help for it, she did as he bade her, and smoked a
little. He felt his heart suddenly inclined in her favour, and he said,
&ldquo;I have seen many beautiful women, but I surely think that you
are the prettiest of them all. Once seeing you, I have quite forgotten
how to eat or sleep. Could you not come to me to live here? I am quite
alone and no one will know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pretended to be greatly scandalized. &ldquo;Your Excellency is a
noble, and I am a low-class woman; how can you think of such a thing?
Do you mean it as a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;I mean it truly, no joke at all.&rdquo; He swore
an oath, saying, &ldquo;Really I mean it, every word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then said, &ldquo;Since you speak so, I am really very grateful,
and shall come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he, &ldquo;Meeting you thus is wonderful indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went on to say, &ldquo;There is another matter, however, that I
wish to call to your attention. I understand that where your Excellency
is now staying is a very sacred place, and that according to ancient
law men were forbidden to have women here. Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor clapped her shoulder, and said, &ldquo;Well, really
now, how is it that you know of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1757" href="#xd25e1757" name="xd25e1757">107</a>]</span>this? You
are right. What shall we do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made answer, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll depend on me, I&rsquo;ll
arrange a plan. My home is near by, and I am also alone, so if you come
quietly at night to me, we can meet and no one will know. I shall send
a felt hat by the boy, and you can wear that for disguise. With this
commoner&rsquo;s felt hat on no one will know you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor was greatly delighted, and said, &ldquo;How is it that
you can plan so wonderfully? I shall do as you suggest. Now you be sure
to be on hand.&rdquo; He repeated this two or three times.</p>
<p>The woman went and entered the house indicated. When evening came
she sent the hat by the boy. The Governor arrived as agreed, and she
received him, lit the lamp, and brought him refreshments and drink.
They talked and drank together, and he called her to come to him. The
woman hesitated for a moment, when suddenly there was a call heard from
the outside, and a great disturbance took place. She bent her head to
listen and then gave a cry of alarm, saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
voice of my husband, who has come. I was unfortunate, and so had this
miserable wretch apportioned to my lot. He is the most despicable among
mortals. For murder and arson he has no <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1765" href="#xd25e1765" name="xd25e1765">108</a>]</span>equal.
Three years ago he left me and I took another husband, and we&rsquo;ve
had nothing to do with each other since. I can&rsquo;t imagine why he
should come now. He is evidently very drunk, too, from the sound of his
voice. Your Excellency has really fallen into a terrible plight. What
shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman went out then and answered, saying, &ldquo;Who comes thus
at midnight to make such a disturbance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice replied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know my voice? Why
don&rsquo;t you open the door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She answered, &ldquo;Are you not <i>Chol-lo</i> (Brass Tiger), and
have we not separated for good, years ago? Why have you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice from without answered back, &ldquo;Your leaving me and
taking another man has always been a matter of deepest resentment on my
part; I have something special to say to you,&rdquo; and he pounded the
door open and came thundering in.</p>
<p>The woman rushed back into the room, saying, &ldquo;Your Excellency
must escape in some way or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In such a little thatched hut there was no place possible for
concealment but an empty rice-box only. &ldquo;Please get into
this,&rdquo; said she, and she lifted the lid and hurried him in. The
Governor, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1783" href="#xd25e1783"
name="xd25e1783">109</a>]</span>in his haste and d&eacute;shabille, was
bundled into the box. He then heard, from within, this fellow come into
the room and quarrel with his wife. She said, &ldquo;We have been
separated three years already; what reason have you to come now and
make such a disturbance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said he, &ldquo;You cast me off and took another man, therefore I
have come for the clothes that I left, and the other things that belong
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she threw out his belongings to him, but he said, pointing to
the box, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not yours; I bought that myself
with two rolls of silk goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one of those rolls I gave you,
and I&rsquo;m not going to let you have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even though you did give it, do you mean to say that for one
roll of silk you will carry away this box? I&rsquo;ll not consent to
it.&rdquo; Thus they quarrelled, and contradicted each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give me the box,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll enter a suit against you at the
Mayor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later the day dawned, and so he had the box carried off to
the Mayor&rsquo;s office to have the case decided by law, while the
woman followed. When they entered the court, already the Mayor was
seated in the judgment-place, and here they presented their case
concerning the box. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1800" href=
"#xd25e1800" name="xd25e1800">110</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Mayor, after hearing, decided thus: &ldquo;Since you each have a
half-share in its purchase, there is nothing for me to do but to divide
it between you. Bring a saw,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The servants brought the saw and began on the box, when suddenly
from the inner regions came forth a cry, &ldquo;Save me; oh, save
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mayor, in pretended astonishment, said, &ldquo;Why,
there&rsquo;s a man&rsquo;s voice from the inside,&rdquo; and ordered
that it should be opened. The servants managed to find the key, and at
last the lid came back, and from the inner quarters there came forth a
half-dressed man.</p>
<p>On seeing him the whole place was put into convulsions of laughter,
for it was none other than the Governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that your Excellency finds yourself in this box in
this unaccountable way?&rdquo; asked the Mayor. &ldquo;Please come
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Governor, huddling himself together as well as he could, climbed
on to the open verandah. He held his head down and nearly died for
shame.</p>
<p>The Mayor, splitting his sides with laughter, ordered clothes to be
brought, and the first thing that came was a woman&rsquo;s green
dress-coat. The Governor hastily turned it inside out, slipped it on,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1815" href="#xd25e1815" name=
"xd25e1815">111</a>]</span>and made a dash for his quarters in the
Confucian Temple. That day he left the place never to return, and even
to the present time in Kyong-ju they laugh and tell the story of the
Boxed-up Governor.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE MAN WHO LOST HIS LEGS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a merchant in Chong-ju who used to go to
Quelpart to buy seaweed. One time when he drew up on the shore he saw a
man shuffling along on the ground toward the boat. He crept nearer, and
at last took hold of the side with both his hands and jumped in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I looked at him,&rdquo; said the merchant, &ldquo;I
found he was an old man without any legs. Astonished, I asked, saying,
&lsquo;How is it, old man, that you have lost your legs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said in reply, &lsquo;I lost my legs on a trip once when I
was shipwrecked, and a great fish bit them
off.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However did that happen?&rdquo; inquired the merchant. And
the old man said, &ldquo;We were caught in a gale and driven till we
touched on some island or other. Before us on the shore stood a high
castle with a great gateway. The twenty or so of us who were together
in the storm-tossed boat were all exhausted from cold and hunger, and
lying <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1835" href="#xd25e1835" name=
"xd25e1835">113</a>]</span>exposed. We landed and managed to go
together to the house. There was in it one man only, whose height was
terrible to behold, and whose chest was many spans round. His face was
black and his eyes large and rolling. His voice was like the braying of
a monster donkey. Our people made motions showing that they wanted
something to eat. The man made no reply, but securely fastened the
front gate. After this he brought an armful of wood, put it in the
middle of the courtyard, and there made a fire. When the fire blazed up
he rushed after us and caught a young lad, one of our company, cooked
him before our eyes, pulled him to pieces and ate him. We were all
reduced to a state of horror, not knowing what to do. We gazed at each
other in dismay and stupefaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he had eaten his fill, he went up into a verandah and
opened a jar, from which he drank some kind of spirit. After drinking
it he uttered the most gruesome and awful noises; his face grew very
red and he lay down and slept. His snorings were like the roarings of
the thunder. We planned then to make our escape, and so tried to open
the large gate, but one leaf was about twenty-four feet across, and so
thick and heavy that with all our strength we could not move it. The
walls, too, were a hundred and fifty feet high, and so we could do
nothing with them. We were like fish in a pot&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1839" href="#xd25e1839" name=
"xd25e1839">114</a>]</span>beyond all possible way of escape. We held
each other&rsquo;s hands, and cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among us, one man thought of this plan: We had a knife and he
took it, and while the monster was drunk and asleep, decided to stab
his eyes out, and cut his throat. We said in reply, &lsquo;We are all
doomed to death, anyway; let&rsquo;s try,&rsquo; and we made our way up
on to the verandah and stabbed his eyes. He gave an awful roar, and
struck out on all sides to catch us. We rushed here and there, making
our escape out of the court back into the rear garden. There were in
this enclosure pigs and sheep, about sixty of them in all. There we
rushed, in among the pigs and sheep. He floundered about, waving his
two arms after us, but not one of us did he get hold of; we were all
mixed up&mdash;sheep, pigs and people. When he did catch anything it
was a sheep; and when it was not a sheep it was a pig. So he opened the
front gate to send all the animals out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We then each of us took a pig or sheep on the back and made
straight for the gate. The monster felt each, and finding it a pig or a
sheep let it go. Thus we all got out and rushed for the boat. A little
later he came and sat on the bank and roared his threatenings at us. A
lot of other giants came at his call. They took steps of thirty feet or
so, came racing after us, caught the boat, and made it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1845" href="#xd25e1845" name=
"xd25e1845">115</a>]</span>fast; but we took axes and struck at the
hands that held it, and so got free at last and out to the open
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again a great wind arose, and we ran on to the rocks and were
all destroyed. Every one was engulfed in the sea and drowned; I alone
got hold of a piece of boat-timber and lived. Then there was a horrible
fish from the sea that came swimming after me and bit off my legs. At
last I drifted back home and here I am.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I think of it still, my teeth are cold and my bones
shiver. My Eight Lucky Stars are very bad, that&rsquo;s why it happened
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">[Han Chun-kyom was the son of a provincial secretary.
He matriculated in the year 1579 and graduated in 1586. He received the
last wishes of King Son-jo, and sat by his side taking notes for seven
hours. From 1608 to 1623 he was <i>generalissimo</i> of the army, and
later was raised to the rank of Prince.]</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>A certain Prince Han of Choong-chong Province had a distant relative
who was an uncouth countryman living in extreme poverty. This relative
came to visit him from time to time. Han pitied his cold and hungry
condition, gave him clothes to wear and shared his food, urging him to
stay and to prolong his visit often into several months. He felt sorry
for him, but disliked his uncouthness and stupidity.</p>
<p>On one of these visits the poor relation suddenly announced his
intention to return home, although the New Year&rsquo;s season was just
at hand. Han urged him to remain, saying, &ldquo;It would be better
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1874" href="#xd25e1874" name=
"xd25e1874">117</a>]</span>for you to be comfortably housed at my home,
eating cake and soup and enjoying quiet sleep rather than riding
through wind and weather at this season of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said at first that he would have to go, until his host so
insistently urged on him to stay that at last he yielded and gave
consent. At New Year&rsquo;s Eve he remarked to Prince Han, &ldquo;I am
possessor of a peculiar kind of magic, by which I have under my control
all manner of evil genii, and New Year is the season at which I call
them up, run over their names, and inspect them. If I did not do so I
should lose control altogether, and there would follow no end of
trouble among mortals. It is a matter of no small moment, and that is
why I wished to go. Since, however, you have detained me, I shall have
to call them up in your Excellency&rsquo;s house and look them over. I
hope you will not object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Han was greatly astonished and alarmed, but gave his consent. The
poor relation went on to say further, &ldquo;This is an extremely
important matter, and I would like to have for it your central guest
hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Han consented to this also, so that night they washed the floors and
scoured them clean. The relation also sat himself with all dignity
facing the south, while Prince Han took up his station on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1882" href="#xd25e1882" name=
"xd25e1882">118</a>]</span>the outside prepared to spy. Soon he saw a
startling variety of demons crushing in at the door, horrible in
appearance and awesome of manner. They lined up one after another, and
still another, and another, till they filled the entire court, each
bowing as he came before the master, who, at this point, drew out a
book, opened it before him, and began calling off the names. Demon
guards who stood by the threshold repeated the call and checked off the
names just as they do in a government <i>yamen</i>. From the second
watch it went on till the fifth of the morning. Han remarked, &ldquo;It
was indeed no lie when he told me &lsquo;ten thousand
devils.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>One late-comer arrived after the marking was over, and still another
came climbing over the wall. The man ordered them to be arrested, and
inquiry made of them under the paddle. The late arrival said, &ldquo;I
really have had a hard time of it of late to live, and so was obliged,
in order to find anything, to inject smallpox into the home of a
scholar who lives in Yong-nam. It is a long way off, and so I have
arrived too late for the roll-call, a serious fault indeed, I
confess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The one who climbed the wall, said, &ldquo;I, too, have known want
and hunger, and so had to insert a little typhus into the family of a
gentleman who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1891" href=
"#xd25e1891" name="xd25e1891">119</a>]</span>lives in Kyong-keui, but
hearing that roll-call was due I came helter-skelter, fearing lest I
should arrive too late, and so climbed the wall, which was indeed a
sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man then, in a loud voice, rated them soundly, saying,
&ldquo;These devils have disobeyed my orders, caused disease and sinned
grievously. Worse than everything, they have climbed the wall of a high
official&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; He ordered a hundred blows to be given
them with the paddle, the <i>cangue</i> to be put on, and to have them
locked fast in prison. Then, calling the others to him, he said,
&ldquo;Do not spread disease! Do you understand?&rdquo; Three times he
ordered it and five times he repeated it. Then they were all dismissed.
The crowd of devils lined off before him, taking their departure and
crushing out through the gate with no end of noise and confusion. After
a long time they had all disappeared.</p>
<p>Prince Han, looking on during this time, saw the man now seated
alone in the hall. It was quiet, and all had vanished. The cocks crew
and morning came. Han was astonished above measure, and asked as to the
law that governed such work as this. The poor relation said in reply,
&ldquo;When I was young I studied in a monastery in the mountains. In
that monastery was an old priest who had a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1901" href="#xd25e1901" name=
"xd25e1901">120</a>]</span>most peculiar countenance. A man feeble and
ready to die, he seemed. All the priests made sport of him and treated
him with contempt. I alone had pity on his age, and often gave him of
my food and always treated him kindly. One evening, when the moon was
bright, the old priest said to me, &lsquo;There is a cave behind this
monastery from which a beautiful view may be had; will you not come
with me and share it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went with him, and when we crossed the ridge of the hills
into the stillness of the night he drew a book from his breast and gave
it to me, saying, &lsquo;I, who am old and ready to die, have here a
great secret, which I have long wished to pass on to some one worthy. I
have travelled over the wide length of Korea, and have never found the
man till now I meet you, and my heart is satisfied, so please receive
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I opened the book and found it a catalogue list of devils,
with magic writing interspersed, and an explanation of the laws that
govern the spirit world. The old priest wrote out one magic recipe, and
having set fire to it countless devils at once assembled, at which I
was greatly alarmed. He then sat with me and called over the names one
after the other, and said to the devils, &lsquo;I am an old man now, am
going away, and so am about to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1907"
href="#xd25e1907" name="xd25e1907">121</a>]</span>put you under the
care of this young man; obey him and all will be well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I already had the book, and so called them to me, read out
the new orders, and dismissed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old priest and I returned to the Temple and went to
sleep. I awoke early next morning and went to call on him, but he was
gone. Thus I came into possession of the magic art, and have possessed
it for a score of years and more. What the world knows nothing of I
have thus made known to your Excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Han was astonished beyond measure, and asked, &ldquo;May I not also
come into possession of this wonderful gift?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man replied, &ldquo;Your Excellency has great ability, and can
do wonderful things; but the possessor of this craft must be one poor
and despised, and of no account. For you, a minister, it would never
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day he left suddenly, and returned no more. Han sent a
servant with a message to him. The servant, with great difficulty, at
last found him alone among a thousand mountain peaks, living in a
little straw hut no bigger than a cockle shell. No neighbours were
there, nor any one beside. He called him, but he refused to come. He
sent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1919" href="#xd25e1919" name=
"xd25e1919">122</a>]</span>another messenger to invite him, but he had
moved away and no trace of him was left.</p>
<p>Prince Han&rsquo;s children had heard this story from himself, and
I, the writer, received it from them.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE HOME OF THE FAIRIES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the days of King In-jo (1623&ndash;1649) there was
a student of Confucius who lived in Ka-pyong. He was still a young man
and unmarried. His education had not been extensive, for he had read
only a little in the way of history and literature. For some reason or
other he left his home and went into Kang-won Province. Travelling on
horseback, and with a servant, he reached a mountain, where he was
overtaken by rain that wet him through. Mysteriously, from some unknown
cause, his servant suddenly died, and the man, in fear and distress,
drew the body to the side of the hill, where he left it and went on his
way weeping. When he had gone but a short distance, the horse he rode
fell under him and died also. Such was his plight: his servant dead,
his horse dead, rain falling fast, and the road an unknown one. He did
not know what to do or where to go, and reduced thus to walking, he
broke down and cried. At this point there met him an old man with very
wonderful eyes, and hair as white as snow. He asked the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1935" href="#xd25e1935" name=
"xd25e1935">124</a>]</span>young man why he wept, and the reply was
that his servant was dead, his horse was dead, that it was raining, and
that he did not know the way. The patriarch, on hearing this, took pity
on him, and lifting his staff, pointed, saying, &ldquo;There is a house
yonder, just beyond those pines, follow that stream and it will bring
you to where there are people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked as directed, and a <i>li</i> or so beyond he
saw a clump of trees. He bowed, thanked the stranger, and started on
his way. When he had gone a few paces he looked back, but the friend
had disappeared. Greatly wondering, he went on toward the place
indicated, and as he drew near he saw a grove of pines, huge trees they
were, a whole forest of them. Bamboos appeared, too, in countless
numbers, with a wide stream of water flowing by. Underneath the water
there seemed to be a marble flooring like a great pavement, white and
pure. As he went along he saw that the water was all of an even depth,
such as one could cross easily. A mile or so farther on he saw a
beautifully decorated house. The pillars and entrance approaches were
perfect in form. He continued his way, wet as he was, carrying his
thorn staff, and entered the gate and sat down to rest. It was paved,
too, with marble, and smooth as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1942" href="#xd25e1942" name="xd25e1942">125</a>]</span>polished
glass. There were no chinks or creases in it, all was of one perfect
surface. In the room was a marble table, and on it a copy of the Book
of Changes; there was also a brazier of jade just in front. Incense was
burning in it, and the fragrance filled the room. Beside these, nothing
else was visible. The rain had ceased and all was quiet and clear, with
no wind nor anything to disturb. The world of confusion seemed to have
receded from him.</p>
<p>While he sat there, looking in astonishment, he suddenly heard the
sound of footfalls from the rear of the building. Startled by it, he
turned to see, when an old man appeared. He looked as though he might
equal the turtle or the crane as to age, and was very dignified. He
wore a green dress and carried a jade staff of nine sections. The
appearance of the old man was such as to stun any inhabitant of the
earth. He recognized him as the master of the place, and so he went
forward and made a low obeisance.</p>
<p>The old man received him kindly, and said, &ldquo;I am the master
and have long waited for you.&rdquo; He took him by the hand and led
him away. As they went along, the hills grew more and more enchanting,
while the soft breezes and the light touched him with mystifying
favour. Suddenly, as he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1948" href=
"#xd25e1948" name="xd25e1948">126</a>]</span>looked the man was gone,
so he went on by himself, and arrived soon at another palace built
likewise of precious stones. It was a great hall, stretching on into
the distance as far as the eye could see.</p>
<p>The young man had seen the Royal Palace frequently when in Seoul
attending examinations, but compared with this, the Royal Palace was as
a mud hut thatched with straw.</p>
<p>As he reached the gate a man in ceremonial robes received him and
led him in. He passed two or three pavilions, and at last reached a
special one and went up to the upper storey. There, reclining at a
table, he saw the ancient sage whom he had met before. Again he
bowed.</p>
<p>This young man, brought up poorly in the country, was never
accustomed to seeing or dealing with the great. In fear, he did not
dare to lift his eyes. The ancient master, however, again welcomed him
and asked him to be seated, saying, &ldquo;This is not the dusty world
that you are accustomed to, but the abode of the genii. I knew you were
coming, and so was waiting to receive you.&rdquo; He turned and called,
saying, &ldquo;Bring something for the guest to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a little a servant brought a richly laden table. It was such fare
as was never seen on earth, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1958" href="#xd25e1958" name="xd25e1958">127</a>]</span>there was
abundance of it. The young man, hungry as he was, ate heartily of these
strange viands. Then the dishes were carried away and the old man said,
&ldquo;I have a daughter who has arrived at a marriageable age, and I
have been trying to find a son-in-law, but as yet have not succeeded.
Your coming accords with this need. Live here, then, and become my
son-in-law.&rdquo; The young man, not knowing what to think, bowed and
was silent. Then the host turned and gave an order, saying, &ldquo;Call
in the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two boys about twelve or thirteen years of age came running in and
sat down beside him. Their faces were so beautifully white they seemed
like jewels. The master pointed to them and said to the guest,
&ldquo;These are my sons,&rdquo; and to the sons he said, &ldquo;This
young man is he whom I have chosen for my son-in-law; when should we
have the wedding? Choose you a lucky day and let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys reckoned over the days on their fingers, and then
together said, &ldquo;The day after to-morrow is a lucky
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man, turning to the stranger, said, &ldquo;That decides as
to the wedding, and now you must wait in the guest-chamber till the
time arrives.&rdquo; He then gave a command to call So and So. In a
little an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1967" href="#xd25e1967"
name="xd25e1967">128</a>]</span>official of the genii came forward,
dressed in light and airy garments. His appearance and expression were
very beautiful, a man, he seemed, of glad and happy mien.</p>
<p>The master said, &ldquo;Show this young man the way to his
apartments and treat him well till the time of the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The official then led the way, and the young man bowed as he left
the room. When he had passed outside the gate, a red sedan chair was in
waiting for him. He was asked to mount. Eight bearers bore him smoothly
along. A mile or so distant they reached another palace, equally
wonderful, with no speck or flaw of any kind to mar its beauty. In
graceful groves of flowers and trees he descended to enter his
pavilion. Beautiful garments were taken from jewelled boxes, and a
perfumed bath was given him and a change made. Thus he laid aside his
weather-beaten clothes and donned the vestments of the genii. The
official remained as company for him till the appointed time.</p>
<p>When that day arrived other beautiful robes were brought, and again
he bathed and changed. When he was dressed, he mounted the palanquin
and rode to the Palace of the master, twenty or more officials
accompanying. On arrival, a guide directed them to the special Palace
Beautiful. Here he saw preparations <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e1975" href="#xd25e1975" name="xd25e1975">129</a>]</span>for the
wedding, and here he made his bow. This finished he moved as directed,
further in. The tinkling sound of jade bells and the breath of sweet
perfumes filled the air. Thus he made his entry into the inner
quarters.</p>
<p>Many beautiful women were in waiting, all gorgeously apparelled,
like the women of the gods. Among these he imagined that he would meet
the master&rsquo;s daughter. In a little, accompanied by a host of
others, she came, shining in jewels and beautiful clothing so that she
lighted up the Palace. He took his stand before her, though her face
was hidden from him by a fan of pearls. When he saw her at last, so
beautiful was she that his eyes were dazzled. The other women, compared
with her, were as the magpie to the ph&oelig;nix. So bewildered was he
that he dared not look up. The friend accompanying assisted him to bow
and to go through the necessary forms. The ceremony was much the same
as that observed among men. When it was over the young man went back to
his bridegroom&rsquo;s chamber. There the embroidered curtains, the
golden screens, the silken clothing, the jewelled floor, were such as
no men of earth ever see.</p>
<p>On the second day his mother-in-law called him to her. Her age would
be about thirty, and her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1981" href=
"#xd25e1981" name="xd25e1981">130</a>]</span>face was like a
freshly-blown lotus flower. Here a great feast was spread, with many
guests invited. The accompaniments thereof in the way of music were
sweeter than mortals ever dreamed of. When the feast was over, the
women caught up their skirts, and, lifting their sleeves, danced
together and sang in sweet accord. The sound of their singing caused
even the clouds to stop and listen. When the day was over, and all had
well dined, the feast broke up.</p>
<p>A young man, brought up in a country hut, had all of a sudden met
the chief of the genii, and had become a sharer in his glory and the
accompaniments of his life. His mind was dazed and his thoughts
overcame him. Doubts were mixed with fears. He knew not what to do.</p>
<p>A sharer in the joys of the fairies he had actually become, and a
year or so passed in such delight as no words can ever describe.</p>
<p>One day his wife said to him, &ldquo;Would you like to enter into
the inner enclosure and see as the fairies see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;Gladly would I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She then led him into a special park where there were lovely walks,
surrounded by green hills. As they advanced there were charming views,
with springs of water and sparkling cascades. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e1994" href="#xd25e1994" name=
"xd25e1994">131</a>]</span>scene grew gradually more entrancing, with
jewelled flowers and scintillating spray, lovely birds and animals
disporting themselves. A man once entering here would never again think
of earth as a place to return to.</p>
<p>After seeing this he ascended the highest peak of all, which was
like a tower of many stories. Before him lay a wide stretch of sea,
with islands of the blessed standing out of the water, and long
stretches of pleasant land in view. His wife showed them all to him,
pointing out this and that. They seemed filled with golden palaces and
surrounded with a halo of light. They were peopled with happy souls,
some riding on cranes, some on the ph&oelig;nix, some on the unicorn;
some were sitting on the clouds, some sailing by on the wind, some
walking on the air, some gliding gently up the streams, some descending
from above, some ascending, some moving west, some north, some
gathering in groups. Flutes and harps sounded sweetly. So many and so
startling were the things seen that he could never tell the tale of
them. After the day had passed they returned.</p>
<p>Thus was their joy unbroken, and when two years had gone by she bore
him two sons.</p>
<p>Time moved on, when one day, unexpectedly, as he was seated with his
wife, he began to cry and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2002"
href="#xd25e2002" name="xd25e2002">132</a>]</span>tears soiled his
face. She asked in amazement for the cause of it. &ldquo;I was
thinking,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of how a plain countryman living in
poverty had thus become the son-in-law of the king of the genii. But in
my home is my poor old mother, whom I have not seen for these years; I
would so like to see her that my tears flow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife laughed, and said, &ldquo;Would you really like to see her?
Then go, but do not cry.&rdquo; She told her father that her husband
would like to go and see his mother. The master called him and gave his
permission. The son thought, of course, that he would call many
servants and send him in state, but not so. His wife gave him one
little bundle and that was all, so he said good-bye to his
father-in-law, whose parting word was, &ldquo;Go now and see your
mother, and in a little I shall call for you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sent with him one servant, and so he passed out through the main
gateway. There he saw a poor thin horse with a worn rag of a saddle on
his back. He looked carefully and found that they were the dead horse
and the dead servant, whom he had lost, restored to him. He gave a
start, and asked, &ldquo;How did you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servant answered, &ldquo;I was coming with you on the road when
some one caught me away and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2010"
href="#xd25e2010" name="xd25e2010">133</a>]</span>brought me here. I
did not know the reason, but I have been here for a long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, in great fear, fastened on his bundle and started on his
journey. The genie servant brought up the rear, but after a short
distance the world of wonder had become transformed into the old weary
world again. Here it was with its fogs, and thorn, and precipice. He
looked off toward the world of the genii, and it was but a dream. So
overcome was he by his feelings that he broke down and cried.</p>
<p>The genie servant said to him when he saw him weeping, &ldquo;You
have been for several years in the abode of the immortals, but you have
not yet attained thereto, for you have not yet forgotten the seven
things of earth: anger, sorrow, fear, ambition, hate and selfishness.
If you once get rid of these there will be no tears for you.&rdquo; On
hearing this he stopped his crying, wiped his cheeks, and asked
pardon.</p>
<p>When he had gone a mile farther he found himself on the main road.
The servant said to him, &ldquo;You know the way from this point on, so
I shall go back,&rdquo; and thus at last the young man reached his
home.</p>
<p>He found there an exorcising ceremony in progress. Witches and
spirit worshippers had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2020"
href="#xd25e2020" name="xd25e2020">134</a>]</span>called and were
saying their prayers. The family, seeing the young man come home thus,
were all aghast. &ldquo;It is his ghost,&rdquo; said they. However,
they saw in a little that it was really he himself. The mother asked
why he had not come home in all that time. She being a very violent
woman in disposition, he did not dare to tell her the truth, so he made
up something else. The day of his return was the anniversary of his
supposed death, and so they had called the witches for a prayer
ceremony. Here he opened the bundle that his wife had given him and
found four suits of clothes, one for each season.</p>
<p>In about a year after his return home the mother, seeing him alone,
made application for the daughter of one of the village
<i>literati</i>. The man, being timid by nature and afraid of offending
his mother, did not dare to refuse, and was therefore married; but
there was no joy in it, and the two never looked at each other.</p>
<p>The young man had a friend whom he had known intimately from
childhood. After his return the friend came to see him frequently, and
they used to spend the nights talking together. In their talks the
friend inquired why in all these years he had never come home. The
young man then told him what had befallen him in the land <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2030" href="#xd25e2030" name=
"xd25e2030">135</a>]</span>of the genii, and how he had been there and
had been married. The friend looked at him in wonder, for he seemed
just as he had remembered him except in the matter of clothing. This he
found on examination was of very strange material, neither grass cloth,
silk nor cotton, but different from them all, and yet warm and
comfortable. When spring came the spring clothes sufficed, when summer
came those for summer, and for autumn and winter each special suit.
They were never washed, and yet never became soiled; they never wore
out, and always looked fresh and new. The friend was greatly
astonished.</p>
<p>Some three years passed when one day there came once more a servant
from the master of the genii, bringing his two sons. There were also
letters, saying, &ldquo;Next year the place where you dwell will be
destroyed and all the people will become &lsquo;fish and meat&rsquo;
for the enemy, therefore follow this messenger and come, all of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told his friend of this and showed him his two sons. The friend,
when he saw these children that looked like silk and jade, confessed
the matter to the mother also. She, too, gladly agreed, and so they
sold out and had a great feast for all the people of the town, and then
bade farewell. This was the year 1635. They left and were never heard
of again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2036" href="#xd25e2036"
name="xd25e2036">136</a>]</span></p>
<p>The year following was the Manchu invasion, when the village where
the young man had lived was all destroyed. To this day young and old in
Ka-pyong tell this story.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Story</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a Korean once, called Song Sang-in, whose
mind was upright and whose spirit was true. He hated witches with all
his might, and regarded them as deceivers of the people. &ldquo;By
their so-called prayers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;they devour the
people&rsquo;s goods. There is no limit to the foolishness and
extravagance that accompanies them. This doctrine of theirs is all
nonsense. Would that I could rid the earth of them and wipe out their
names for ever.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2057" href=
"#xd25e2057" name="xd25e2057">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some time later Song was appointed magistrate of Nam Won County in
Chulla Province. On his arrival he issued the following order:
&ldquo;If any witch is found in this county, let her be beaten to
death.&rdquo; The whole place was so thoroughly spied upon that all the
witches made their escape to other prefectures. The magistrate thought,
&ldquo;Now we are rid of them, and that ends the matter for this county
at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On a certain day he went out for a walk, and rested for a time at
<i>Kwang-han</i> Pavilion. As he looked out from his coign of vantage,
he saw a woman approaching on horseback with a witch&rsquo;s drum on
her head. He looked intently to make sure, and to his astonishment he
saw that she was indeed a <i>mutang</i> (witch). He sent a
<i>yamen</i>-runner to have her arrested, and when she was brought
before him he asked, &ldquo;Are you a <i>mutang</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied, &ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you did not know of the official
order issued?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I heard of it,&rdquo; was her reply.</p>
<p>He then asked, &ldquo;Are you not afraid to die, that you stay here
in this county?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>mutang</i> bowed, and made answer, &ldquo;I have a matter of
complaint to lay before your Excellency to be put right; please take
note of it and grant my request. It is this: There are true
<i>mutangs</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2090" href=
"#xd25e2090" name="xd25e2090">139</a>]</span>and false <i>mutangs</i>.
False <i>mutangs</i> ought to be killed, but you would not kill an
honest <i>mutang</i>, would you? Your orders pertain to false
<i>mutangs</i>; I do not understand them as pertaining to those who are
true. I am an honest <i>mutang</i>; I knew you would not kill me, so I
remained here in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrate asked, &ldquo;How do you know that there are honest
<i>mutangs</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman replied, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put the matter to the test and
see. If I am not proven honest, let me die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the magistrate; &ldquo;but can you
really make good, and do you truly know how to call back departed
spirits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>mutang</i> answered, &ldquo;I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrate suddenly thought of an intimate friend who had been
dead for some time, and he said to her, &ldquo;I had a friend of such
and such rank in Seoul; can you call his spirit back to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>mutang</i> replied, &ldquo;Let me do so; but first you must
prepare food, with wine, and serve it properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrate thought for a moment, and then said to himself,
&ldquo;It is a serious matter to take a person&rsquo;s life; let me
find out first if she is true or not, and then decide.&rdquo; So he had
the food brought. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2132" href=
"#xd25e2132" name="xd25e2132">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>mutang</i> said also, &ldquo;I want a suit of your clothes,
too, please.&rdquo; This was brought, and she spread her mat in the
courtyard, placed the food in order, donned the dress, and so made all
preliminary arrangements. She then lifted her eyes toward heaven and
uttered the strange magic sounds by which spirits are called, meanwhile
shaking a tinkling bell. In a little she turned and said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come.&rdquo; Then she began telling the sad story of
his sickness and death and their separation. She reminded the
magistrate of how they had played together, and of things that had
happened when they were at school at their lessons; of the difficulties
they had met in the examinations; of experiences that had come to them
during their terms of office. She told secrets that they had confided
to each other as intimate friends, and many matters most definitely
that only they two knew. Not a single mistake did she make, but told
the truth in every detail.</p>
<p>The magistrate, when he heard these things, began to cry, saying,
&ldquo;The soul of my friend is really present; I can no longer doubt
or deny it.&rdquo; Then he ordered the choicest fare possible to be
prepared as a sacrifice to his friend. In a little the friend bade him
farewell and took his departure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e2140" href="#xd25e2140" name="xd25e2140">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>The magistrate said, &ldquo;Alas! I thought <i>mutangs</i> were a
brood of liars, but now I know that there are true <i>mutangs</i> as
well as false.&rdquo; He gave her rich rewards, sent her away in
safety, recalled his order against witches, and refrained from any
matters pertaining to them for ever after.</p>

<h2 class="main">WHOM THE KING HONOURS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the days of King Se-jong students of the Confucian
College were having a picnic to celebrate the Spring Festival. They met
in a wood to the north of the college, near a beautiful spring of
water, and were drinking and feasting the night through. While they
were thus enjoying themselves the rooms of the college were left
deserted. One student from the country, a backwoodsman in his way, who
was of no account to others, thought that while the rest went away to
enjoy themselves some one ought to stay behind to guard the sacred
precincts of the temple; so he decided that he would forgo the
pleasures of the picnic, stay behind and watch.</p>
<p>The King at that time sent a eunuch to the college to see how many
of the students had remained on guard. The eunuch returned, saying that
all had gone off on the picnic, except one man, a raw countryman, who
was in sole charge. The King at once sent for the man, asking him to
come just as he was in his common clothes. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2163" href="#xd25e2163" name=
"xd25e2163">143</a>]</span></p>
<p>On his arrival his Majesty asked, &ldquo;When all have gone off for
a gay time, why is it that you remain alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;I, too, would like to have gone, but to leave the
sacred temple wholly deserted did not seem to me right, so I
stayed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King was greatly pleased with this reply, and asked again,
&ldquo;Do you know how to write verses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reply was, &ldquo;I know only very little about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King then said, &ldquo;I have one-half of a verse here which
runs thus&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;After the rains the mountains weep.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">You write me a mate for this line to go with
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the student replied&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Before the wind the grass is tipsy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The King, delighted, praised him for his skill and
made him a special graduate on the spot, gave him his diploma, flowers
for his hat, and issued a proclamation saying that he had passed the
<i>Al-song</i> Examination. At once he ordered for him the head-gear,
the red coat, a horse to ride on, two boys to go before, flute-players
and harpers, saying, &ldquo;Go now to the picnic-party and show
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the picnickers were thus engaged, suddenly they heard the
sound of flutes and harps, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2192"
href="#xd25e2192" name="xd25e2192">144</a>]</span>they questioned as to
what it could mean. This was not the time for new graduates to go
abroad. While they looked, behold, here came a victorious candidate,
dressed in ceremonial robes, heralded by boys, and riding on the
King&rsquo;s palfrey, to greet them. On closer view they saw that it
was the uncouth countryman whom they had left behind at the Temple.
They asked what it meant, and then learned, to their amazement, that
the King had so honoured him. The company, in consternation and
surprise, broke up and returned home at once.</p>
<p>This special graduate became later, through the favour of the King,
a great and noted man.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE FORTUNES OF YOO</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a man of Yong-nam, named Yoo, who lived in
the days of Se-jong. He had studied the classics, had passed his
examinations, and had become a petty official attached to the Confucian
College. He was not even of the sixth degree, so that promotion was out
of the question. He was a countryman who had no friends and no
influence, and though he had long been in Seoul there was no likelihood
of any advancement. Such being the case, disheartened and lonely, he
decided to leave the city and go back to his country home.</p>
<p>There was a palace secretary who knew this countryman, and who went
to say good-bye to him before he left.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the opportunity, the countryman said, &ldquo;I
have long been in Seoul, but have never yet seen the royal office of
the secretaries. Might I accompany you some day when you take your
turn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary said, &ldquo;In the daytime there is always a crowd of
people who gather there for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2214"
href="#xd25e2214" name="xd25e2214">146</a>]</span>business, and no one
is allowed in without a special pass. I am going in to-morrow, however,
and intend to sleep there, so that in the evening we could have a good
chance to look the Palace over. People are not allowed to sleep in the
Palace as a rule, but doing so once would not be specially
noticed.&rdquo; The secretary then gave orders to the military guard
who accompanied him to escort this man in the next day.</p>
<p>As the secretary had arranged, the countryman, on the evening
following, made his way into the Palace enclosure, but what was his
surprise to find that, for some reason or other, the secretary had not
come. The gates, also, were closed behind him, so that he could not get
out. Really he was in a fix. There chanced to be a body-servant of the
secretary in the room, and he, feeling sorry for the stranger, arranged
a hidden corner where he might pass the night, and then quietly take
his departure in the morning.</p>
<p>The night was beautifully clear, and apparently every one slept but
Yoo. He was wide awake, and wondering to himself if he might not go
quietly out and see the place.</p>
<p>It was the time of the rainy season, and a portion of the wall had
fallen from the enclosure just in front. So Yoo climbed over this
broken wall, and, not knowing where he went, found himself suddenly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2222" href="#xd25e2222" name=
"xd25e2222">147</a>]</span>in the royal quarters. It was a beautiful
park, with trees, and lakes, and walks. &ldquo;Whose house is
this,&rdquo; thought Yoo, &ldquo;with its beautiful garden?&rdquo;
Suddenly a man appeared, with a nice new cap on his head, carrying a
staff in his hand, and accompanied by a servant, walking slowly towards
him. It was no other than King Se-jong, taking a stroll in the
moonlight with one of his eunuchs.</p>
<p>When they met Yoo had no idea that it was the King. His Majesty
asked, &ldquo;Who are you, and how did you get in here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told who he was, and how he had agreed to come in with the
secretary; how the secretary had failed; how the gates were shut and he
was a prisoner for the night; how he had seen the bright moonlight and
wished to walk out, and, finding the broken wall, had come over.
&ldquo;Whose house is this, anyway?&rdquo; asked Yoo.</p>
<p>The King replied, &ldquo;I am the master of this house.&rdquo; His
Majesty then asked him in, and made him sit down on a mat beside him.
So they talked and chatted together. The King learned that he had
passed special examinations in the classics, and inquiring how it was
that Yoo had had no better office, Yoo replied that he was an unknown
countryman, that his family had no influence, and that, while he
desired office, he was forestalled by the powerful families of the
capital. &ldquo;Who is there,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e2231" href="#xd25e2231" name="xd25e2231">148</a>]</span>he asked,
&ldquo;that would bother himself about me? Thus all my hopes have
failed, and I have just decided to leave the city and go back home and
live out my days there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King asked again, &ldquo;You know the classics so well, do you
know something also of the Book of Changes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;The deeper parts I do not know, but the easier
parts only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the King ordered a eunuch to bring the Book of Changes. It was
the time when his Majesty was reading it for himself. The book was
brought and opened in the moonlight. The King looked up a part that had
given him special difficulty, and this the stranger explained character
by character, giving the meaning with convincing clearness. The King
was delighted and wondered greatly, and so they read together all
through the night. When they separated the King said, &ldquo;You have
all this knowledge and yet have never been made use of? Alas, for my
country!&rdquo; said he, sighing.</p>
<p>Yoo remarked that he would like to go straight home now, if the
master would kindly open the door for him.</p>
<p>The King said, however, that it was too early yet, and that he might
be arrested by the guards <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2243"
href="#xd25e2243" name="xd25e2243">149</a>]</span>who were about.
&ldquo;Go then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to where you were, and when it
is broad daylight you can go through the open gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yoo then bade good-bye, and went back over the broken wall to his
corner in the secretary&rsquo;s room. When morning came he went out
through the main gateway and returned to his home.</p>
<p>On the following day the King sent a special secretary and had Yoo
appointed to the office of Overseer of Literature. On the promulgation
of this the officials gathered in the public court, and protested in
high dudgeon against so great an office being given to an unknown
person.</p>
<p>His Majesty, however, said, &ldquo;If you are so opposed to it,
I&rsquo;ll desist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the day following he appointed him to an office one degree still
higher. Again they all protested, and his Majesty said, &ldquo;Really,
if you so object, I&rsquo;ll drop the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day following he appointed him to an office still one degree
higher. Again they all protested and he apparently yielded to them. But
the day following higher still he was promoted, and again the protests
poured in, so much so that his Majesty seemed to yield. On the day
following this the King wrote out for him the office of Vice-President
of all the <i>Literati</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2258"
href="#xd25e2258" name="xd25e2258">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>The high officials gathered again and inquired of one another as to
what the King meant, and what they had better do about it. &ldquo;If we
do not in some way prevent it, he will appoint him as President of the
<i>Literati</i>.&rdquo; They decided to drop the matter for the
present, and see later what was best to do.</p>
<p>A royal banquet was announced to take place, when all the officials
gathered. On this occasion the high Ministers of State said quietly to
the King, &ldquo;It is not fitting that so obscure a person have so
important an office. Your Majesty&rsquo;s promoting him as you have
done has thrown the whole official body into a state of consternation.
On our protest you have merely promoted him more. What is your
Majesty&rsquo;s reason, please, for this action?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King made no reply, but ordered a eunuch to bring the Book of
Changes. He opened it at the place of special difficulty, and inquired
as to its meaning. Even among the highest ministers not one could give
an answer. He inquired by name of this one and that, but all were
silent. The King then said, &ldquo;I am greatly interested in the
reading of the Book of Changes; it is the great book of the sages. Any
one who understands it surely ought to be promoted. You, all of you,
fail to grasp its meaning, while Yoo, whom you protest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2269" href="#xd25e2269" name=
"xd25e2269">151</a>]</span>against, has explained it all to me. Now
what have you to say? Yoo&rsquo;s being promoted thus is just as it
ought to be. Why do you object? I shall promote him still more and
more, so cease from all opposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were afraid and ashamed, and did not again mention it.</p>
<p>Yoo from that time on became the royal teacher of the
<i>Choo-yuk</i> (Book of Changes), and rose higher and higher in rank,
till he became Head of the Confucian College and first in influence,
surpassing all.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Many people of ability have no chance for
promotion. It is difficult to have one&rsquo;s gifts known in high
places; how much more difficult before a king? The good fortune that
fell to the first scholar was of God&rsquo;s appointment. By caring for
a vacant house the honour came to him, and he was promoted. The
other&rsquo;s going thus unbidden into the Palace was a great wrong,
but by royal favour he was pardoned, received and honoured.</p>
<p>By one line of poetry a man&rsquo;s ability was made manifest, and
by one explanation of the <i>Choo-yuk</i> another&rsquo;s path was
opened to high promotion.</p>
<p>If Se-jong had not been a great and enlightened king, how could it
have happened? Very rare are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2291"
href="#xd25e2291" name="xd25e2291">152</a>]</span>such happenings,
indeed! So all men wondered over what had befallen these two. I,
however, wondered more over the King&rsquo;s sagacity in finding them.
To my day his virtue and accomplishments are known, so that the world
calls him Korea&rsquo;s King of the Golden Age.</p>

<h2 class="label">XXVIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">AN ENCOUNTER WITH A HOBGOBLIN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I got myself into trouble in the year Pyong-sin, and
was locked up; a military man by the name of Choi Won-so, who was
captain of the guard, was involved in it and locked up as well. We
often met in prison and whiled away the hours talking together. On a
certain day the talk turned on goblins, when Captain Choi said,
&ldquo;When I was young I met with a hobgoblin, which, by the fraction
of a hair, almost cost me my life. A strange case indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked him to tell me of it, when he replied, &ldquo;I had
originally no home in Seoul, but hearing of a vacant place in Belt
Town, I made application and got it. We went there, my father and the
rest of the family occupying the inner quarters, while I lived in the
front room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night, late, when I was half asleep, the door suddenly
opened, and a woman came in and stood just before the lamp. I saw her
clearly, and knew that she was from the home of a scholar friend, for I
had seen her before and had been greatly attracted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2309" href="#xd25e2309" name=
"xd25e2309">154</a>]</span>by her beauty, but had never had a chance to
meet her. Now, seeing her enter the room thus, I greeted her gladly,
but she made no reply. I arose to take her by the hand, when she began
walking backwards, so that my hand never reached her. I rushed towards
her, but she hastened her backward pace, so that she eluded me. We
reached the gate, which she opened with a rear kick, and I followed on
after, till she suddenly disappeared. I searched on all sides, but not
a trace was there of her. I thought she had merely hidden herself, and
never dreamed of anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the next night she came again and stood before the lamp
just as she had done the night previous. I got up and again tried to
take hold of her, but again she began her peculiar pace backwards, till
she passed out at the gate and disappeared just as she had done the day
before. I was once more surprised and disappointed, but did not think
of her being a hobgoblin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few days later, at night, I had lain down, when suddenly
there was a sound of crackling paper overhead from above the ceiling. A
forbidding, creepy sound it seemed in the midnight. A moment later a
curtain was let down that divided the room into two parts. Again,
later, a large fire of coals descended right in front of me, while an
immense heat filled the place. Where I was seemed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2315" href="#xd25e2315" name=
"xd25e2315">155</a>]</span>all on fire, with no way of escape possible.
In terror for my life, I knew not what to do. On the first cock-crow of
morning the noise ceased, the curtain went up, and the fire of coals
was gone. The place was as though swept with a broom, so clean from
every trace of what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The following night I was again alone, but had not yet
undressed or lain down, when a great stout man suddenly opened the door
and came in. He had on his head a soldier&rsquo;s felt hat, and on his
body a blue tunic like one of the underlings of the <i>yamen</i>. He
took hold of me and tried to drag me out. I was then young and
vigorous, and had no intention of yielding to him, so we entered on a
tussle. The moon was bright and the night clear, but I, unable to hold
my own, was pulled out into the court. He lifted me up and swung me
round and round, then went up to the highest terrace and threw me down,
so that I was terribly stunned. He stood in front of me and kept me a
prisoner. There was a garden to the rear of the house, and a wall round
it. I looked, and within the wall were a dozen or so of people. They
were all dressed in military hats and coats, and they kept shouting
out, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him, don&rsquo;t hurt him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man that mishandled me, however, said in reply,
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business, none of your business&rsquo;;
but they still kept up the cry, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2324" href="#xd25e2324" name=
"xd25e2324">156</a>]</span>hurt him, don&rsquo;t hurt him&rsquo;; and
he, on the other hand, cried, &lsquo;Never you mind; none of your
business.&rsquo; They shouted, &lsquo;The man is a gentleman of the
military class; do not hurt him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow merely said in reply, &lsquo;Even though he is,
it&rsquo;s none of your business&rsquo;; so he took me by the two hands
and flung me up into the air, till I went half-way and more to heaven.
Then in my fall I went shooting past Kyong-keui Province, past
Choong-chong, and at last fell to the ground in Chulla. In my flight
through space I saw all the county towns of the three provinces as
clear as day. Again in Chulla he tossed me up once more. Again I went
shooting up into the sky and falling northward, till I found myself at
home, lying stupefied below the verandah terrace. Once more I could
hear the voices of the group in the garden shouting, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
hurt him&mdash;hurt him.&rsquo; But the man said, &lsquo;None of your
business&mdash;your business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took me up once more and flung me up again, and away I
went speeding off to Chulla, and back I came again, two or three times
in all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one of the group in the garden came forward, took my
tormentor by the hand and led him away. They all met for a little to
talk and laugh over the matter, and then scattered and were gone, so
that they were not seen again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lay motionless at the foot of the terrace till <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2335" href="#xd25e2335" name=
"xd25e2335">157</a>]</span>the following morning, when my father found
me and had me taken in hand and cared for, so that I came to, and we
all left the haunted house, never to go back.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;There are various reasons by which a place may be
denominated a &ldquo;haunted house.&rdquo; The fact that there are
hobgoblins in it makes it haunted. If a good or &ldquo;superior
man&rdquo; enters such a place the goblins move away, and no word of
being haunted will be heard. Choi saw the goblin and was greatly
injured.</p>
<p>I understand that it is not only a question of men fearing the
goblins, but they also fear men. The fact that there are so few people
that they fear is the saddest case of all. Choi was afraid of the
goblins, that is why they troubled him.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE SNAKE&rsquo;S REVENGE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There lived in ancient days an archer, whose home was
near the Water Gate of Seoul. He was a man of great strength and famous
for his valour.</p>
<p>Water Gate has reference to a hole under the city wall, by which the
waters of the Grand Canal find their exit. In it are iron pickets to
prevent people&rsquo;s entering or departing by that way.</p>
<p>On a certain afternoon when this military officer was taking a walk,
a great snake was seen making its way by means of the Water Gate. The
snake&rsquo;s head had already passed between the bars, but its body,
being larger, could not get through, so there it was held fast. The
soldier drew an arrow, and, fitting it into the string, shot the snake
in the head. Its head being fatally injured, the creature died. The
archer then drew it out, pounded it into a pulp, and left it.</p>
<p>A little time later the man&rsquo;s wife conceived and bore a son.
From the first the child was afraid of its father, and when it saw him
it used to cry and seem greatly frightened. As it grew it hated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2363" href="#xd25e2363" name=
"xd25e2363">159</a>]</span>the sight of its father more and more. The
man became suspicious of this, and so, instead of loving his son, he
grew to dislike him.</p>
<p>On a certain day, when there were just the two of them in the room,
the officer lay down to have a midday siesta, covering his face with
his sleeve, but all the while keeping his eye on the boy to see what he
would do. The child glared at his father, and thinking him asleep, got
a knife and made a thrust at him. The man jumped, grabbed the knife,
and then with a club gave the boy a blow that left him dead on the
spot. He pounded him into a pulp, left him and went away. The mother,
however, in tears, covered the little form with a quilt and prepared
for its burial. In a little the quilt began to move, and she in alarm
raised it to see what had happened, when lo! beneath it the child was
gone and there lay coiled a huge snake instead. The mother jumped back
in fear, left the room and did not again enter.</p>
<p>When evening came the husband returned and heard the dreadful story
from his wife. He went in and looked, and now all had metamorphosed
into a huge snake. On the head of it was the scar mark of the arrow
that he had shot. He said to the snake, &ldquo;You and I were
originally not enemies, I therefore did wrong in shooting you as I did;
but your intention to take revenge through <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2369" href="#xd25e2369" name=
"xd25e2369">160</a>]</span>becoming my son was a horrible deed. Such a
thing as this is proof that my suspicions of you were right and just.
You became my son in order to kill me, your father; why, therefore,
should I not in my turn kill you? If you attempt it again, it will
certainly end in my taking your life. You have already had your
revenge, and have once more transmigrated into your original shape, let
us drop the past and be friends from now on. What do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated this over and urged his proposals, while the snake with
bowed head seemed to listen intently. He then opened the door and said,
&ldquo;Now you may go as you please.&rdquo; The snake then departed,
making straight for the Water Gate, and passed out between the bars. It
did not again appear.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Man is a spiritual being, and different from all
other created things, and though a snake has power of venom, it is
still an insignificant thing compared with a man. The snake died, and
by means of the transmigration of its soul took its revenge. Man dies,
but I have never heard that he can transmigrate as the snake did. Why
is it that though a spiritual being he is unable to do what beasts do?
I have seen many innocent men killed, but not one of them has ever
returned to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2379" href="#xd25e2379"
name="xd25e2379">161</a>]</span>take his revenge on the lawless one who
did it, and so I wonder more than ever over these stories of the snake.
The Superior Man&rsquo;s knowing nothing of the law that governs these
things is a regret to me.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE BRAVE MAGISTRATE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In olden times in one of the counties of North
Ham-kyong Province, there was an evil-smelling goblin that caused great
destruction to life. Successive magistrates appeared, but in ten days
or so after arrival, in each case they died in great agony, so that no
man wished to have the billet or anything to do with the place. A
hundred or more were asked to take the post, but they all refused. At
last one brave soldier, who was without any influence socially or
politically, accepted. He was a courageous man, strong and fearless. He
thought, &ldquo;Even though there is a devil there, all men will not
die, surely. I shall make a trial of him.&rdquo; So he said his
farewell, and entered on his office. He found himself alone in the
yamen, as all others had taken flight. He constantly carried a long
knife at his belt, and went thus armed, for he noticed from the first
day a fishy, stinking odour, that grew gradually more and more
marked.</p>
<p>After five or six days he took note, too, that what <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2395" href="#xd25e2395" name=
"xd25e2395">163</a>]</span>looked like a mist would frequently make its
entry by the outer gate, and from this mist came this stinking smell.
Daily it grew more and more annoying, so that he could not stand it
longer. In ten days or so, when the time arrived for him to die, the
<i>yamen</i>-runners and servants, who had returned, again ran away.
The magistrate kept a jar of whisky by his side, from which he drank
frequently to fortify his soul. On this day he grew very drunk, and
thus waited. At last he saw something coming through the main gateway
that seemed wrapped in fog, three or four embraces in waist size, and
fifteen feet or so high. There was no head to it, nor were body or arms
visible. Only on the top were two dreadful eyes rolling wildly. The
magistrate jumped up at once, rushed toward it, gave a great shout and
struck it with his sword. When he gave it the blow there was the sound
of thunder, and the whole thing dissipated. Also the foul smell that
accompanied it disappeared at once.</p>
<p>The magistrate then, in a fit of intoxication, fell prone. The
retainers, all thinking him dead, gathered in the courtyard to prepare
for his burial. They saw him fallen to the earth, but they remarked
that the bodies of others who had died from this evil had all been left
on the verandah, but his was in the lower court. They raised him up in
order to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2402" href="#xd25e2402"
name="xd25e2402">164</a>]</span>prepare him for burial, when suddenly
he came to life, looked at them in anger, and asked what they meant.
Fear and amazement possessed them. From that time on there was no more
smell.</p>

<p>At twelve years of age he was proud, we are told, and haughty. He
dressed well, and was envied by the poorer lads of the place, and once
he took off his coat and gave it to a boy who looked with envy on him.
He gave his shoes as well, and came back barefoot. His mother, wishing
to know his mind in the matter, pretended to reprimand him, but he
replied, saying, &ldquo;Mother, when others wanted it so, how could I
refuse giving?&rdquo; His mother pondered these things in her
heart.</p>
<p>When he was fifteen he was strong and well-built, and liked vigorous
exercise, so that he was a noted wrestler and skilful at shuttlecock.
His mother, however, frowned upon these things, saying that they were
not dignified, so that he gave them up and confined his attention to
literary studies, graduating at twenty-five years of age.</p>
<p>In 1592, during the Japanese War, when the King escaped to Eui-ju,

Hang-bok?&rdquo; Yang Ho, the general of the rescuing forces, also

<p class="first">During the Japanese War in the reign of Son-jo, the
Mings sent a great army that came east, drove out the enemy and
restored peace. At that time the general of the Mings informed his
Korean Majesty that the victory was due to the help of Kwan, the God of
War. &ldquo;This being the case,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you ought not
to continue without temples in which to express your gratitude to
him.&rdquo; So they built him houses of worship and offered him
sacrifice. The Temples built were one to the south and one to the east
of the city. In examining sites for these they could not agree on the
one to the south. Some wanted it nearer the wall and some farther away.
At that time an official, called Yi Hang-bok, was in charge of the
conference. On a certain day when Yi was at home a military officer
called and wished to see him. Ordering him in he found him a great
strapping fellow, splendidly built. His request was that Yi should
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2478" href="#xd25e2478" name=
"xd25e2478">168</a>]</span>send out all his retainers till he talked to
him privately. They were sent out, and then the stranger gave his
message. After he had finished, he said good-bye and left.</p>
<p>Yi had at that time an old friend stopping with him. The friend went
out with the servants when they were asked to leave, and now he came
back again. When he came in he noticed that the face of the master had
a very peculiar expression, and he asked him the reason of it. Yi made
no reply at first, but later told his friend that a very extraordinary
thing had happened. The military man who had come and called was none
other than a messenger of the God of War. His coming, too, was on
account of their not yet having decided in regard to the site for the
Temple. &ldquo;He came,&rdquo; said Yi, &ldquo;to show me where it
ought to be. He urged that it was not a matter for time only, but for
the eternities to come. If we do not get it right the God of War will
find no peace. I told him in reply that I would do my best. Was this
not strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The friend who heard this was greatly exercised, but Yi warned him
not to repeat it to any one. Yi used all his efforts, and at last the
building was placed on the approved site, where it now stands.</p>

<p class="first">[Choi Yu-won.&mdash;(The story of meeting his
mother&rsquo;s ghost is reported to be of this man.)</p>
<p>Choi Yu-won matriculated in 1579 and graduated in 1602, becoming
Chief Justice and having conferred on him the rank of prince. When he
was a boy his great-aunt once gave him cloth for a suit of clothes, but
he refused to accept of it, and from this his aunt prophesied that he
would yet become a famous man. He studied in the home of the great
teacher Yul-gok, and Yul-gok also foretold that the day would come when
he would be an honour to Korea.</p>
<p>Yu-won once met Chang Han-kang and inquired of him concerning
<i>Pyon-wha Keui-jil</i> (a law by which the weak became strong, the
wicked good, and the stupid wise). He also asked that if one be truly
transformed will the soul change as well as the body, or the body only?
Chang replied, &ldquo;Both are changed, for how could the body change
without the soul?&rdquo; Yu-won asked Yul-gok concerning <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2503" href="#xd25e2503" name=
"xd25e2503">170</a>]</span>this also, and Yul-gok replied that
Chang&rsquo;s words were true.</p>
<p>In 1607 Choi Yu-won memorialized the King, calling attention to a
letter received from Japan in answer to a communication sent by his
Majesty, which had on its address the name of the Prime Minister,
written a space lower than good form required. The Korean envoy had not
protested, as duty would require of him, and yet the King had advanced
him in rank. The various officials commended him for his courage.</p>
<p>In 1612, while he was Chief Justice, King Kwang-hai tried to degrade
the Queen Dowager, who was not his own mother, he being born of a
concubine, but Yu-won besought him with tears not to do so illegal and
unnatural a thing. Still the King overrode all opposition, and did
according to his unfilial will. In it all Choi Yu-won was proven a good
man and a just. He used to say to his companions, even as a youth,
&ldquo;Death is dreadful, but still, better death for
righteousness&rsquo; sake and honour than life in disgrace.&rdquo;
Another saying of his runs, &ldquo;All one&rsquo;s study is for the
development of character; if it ends not in that it is in
vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Korea&rsquo;s ancient belief was that the blood of a faithful son
served as an elixir of life to the dying, so that when his mother was
at the point of death <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2511" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a minister in olden days who once, when he
was Palace Secretary, was getting ready for office in the morning. He
had on his ceremonial dress. It was rather early, and as he leaned on
his arm-rest for a moment, sleep overcame him. He dreamt, and in the
dream he thought he was mounted and on his journey. He was crossing the
bridge at the entrance to East Palace Street, when suddenly he saw his
mother coming towards him on foot. He at once dismounted, bowed, and
said, &ldquo;Why do you come thus, mother, not in a chair, but on
foot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied, &ldquo;I have already left the world, and things are
not where I am as they are where you are, and so I walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary asked, &ldquo;Where are you going, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She replied, &ldquo;We have a servant living at Yong-san, and they
are having a witches&rsquo; prayer service there just now, so I am
going to partake of the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the secretary, &ldquo;we have sacrificial
days, many of them, at our own home, those of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2527" href="#xd25e2527" name=
"xd25e2527">172</a>]</span>four seasons, also on the first and
fifteenth of each month. Why do you go to a servant&rsquo;s house and
not to mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother replied, &ldquo;Your sacrifices are of no interest to me,
I like the prayers of the witches. If there is no medium we spirits
find no satisfaction. I am in a hurry,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
cannot wait longer,&rdquo; so she spoke her farewell and was gone.</p>
<p>The secretary awoke with a start, but felt that he had actually seen
what had come to pass.</p>
<p>He then called a servant and told him to go at once to
So-and-So&rsquo;s house in Yong-san, and tell a certain servant to come
that night without fail. &ldquo;Go quickly,&rdquo; said the secretary,
&ldquo;so that you can be back before I enter the Palace.&rdquo; Then
he sat down to meditate over it.</p>
<p>In a little the servant had gone and come again. It was not yet
broad daylight, and because it was cold the servant did not enter
straight, but went first into the kitchen to warm his hands before the
fire. There was a fellow-servant there who asked him, &ldquo;Have you
had something to drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;They are having a big witch business on at
Yong-san, and while the <i>mutang</i> (witch) was performing, she said
that the spirit that possessed her was the mother of the master here.
On my appearance she called out my name and said, &lsquo;This is a
servant from our house.&rsquo; Then she <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e2542" href="#xd25e2542" name="xd25e2542">173</a>]</span>called me
and gave me a big glass of spirit. She added further, &lsquo;On my way
here I met my son going into the Palace.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary, overhearing this talk from the room where he was
waiting, broke down and began to cry. He called in the servant and made
fuller inquiry, and more than ever he felt assured that his
mother&rsquo;s spirit had really gone that morning to share in the
<i>koot</i> (witches&rsquo; sacrificial ceremony). He then called the
<i>mutang</i>, and in behalf of the spirit of his mother made her a
great offering. Ever afterwards he sacrificed to her four times a year
at each returning season.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE FEARLESS CAPTAIN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was formerly a soldier, Yee Man-ji of Yong-nam,
a strong and muscular fellow, and brave as a lion. He had green eyes
and a terrible countenance. Frequently he said, &ldquo;Fear! What is
fear?&rdquo; On a certain day when he was in his house a sudden storm
of rain came on, when there were flashes of lightning and heavy claps
of thunder. At one of them a great ball of fire came tumbling into his
home and went rolling over the verandah, through the rooms, into the
kitchen and out into the yard, and again into the servants&rsquo;
quarters. Several times it went and came bouncing about. Its blazing
light and the accompanying noise made it a thing of terror.</p>
<p>Yee sat in the outer verandah, wholly undisturbed. He thought to
himself, &ldquo;I have done no wrong, therefore why need I fear the
lightning?&rdquo; A moment later a flash struck the large elm tree in
front of the house and smashed it to pieces. The rain then ceased and
the thunder likewise.</p>
<p>Yee turned to see how it fared with his family, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2569" href="#xd25e2569" name=
"xd25e2569">175</a>]</span>and found them all fallen senseless. With
the greatest of difficulty he had them restored to life. During that
year they all fell ill and died, and Yee came to Seoul and became a
Captain of the Right Guard. Shortly after he went to North Ham-kyong
Province. There he took a second wife and settled down. All his
predecessors had died of goblin influences, and the fact that calamity
had overtaken them while in the official quarters had caused them to
use one of the village houses instead.</p>
<p>Yee, however, determined to live down all fear and go back to the
old quarters, which he extensively repaired.</p>
<p>One night his wife was in the inner room while he was alone in the
public office with a light burning before him. In the second watch or
thereabout, a strange-looking object came out of the inner quarters. It
looked like the stump of a tree wrapped in black sackcloth. There was
no outline or definite shape to it, and it came jumping along and sat
itself immediately before Yee Man-ji. Also two other objects came
following in its wake, shaped just like the first one. The three then
sat in a row before Yee, coming little by little closer and closer to
him. Yee moved away till he had backed up against the wall and could go
no farther. Then he said, &ldquo;Who are you, anyhow; what kind of
devil, pray, that you dare to push towards me so in my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2575" href="#xd25e2575" name=
"xd25e2575">176</a>]</span>office? If you have any complaint or matter
to set right, say so, and I&rsquo;ll see to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The middle devil said in reply, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry, I&rsquo;m
hungry, I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yee answered, &ldquo;Hungry, are you? Very well, now just move back
and I&rsquo;ll have food prepared for you in abundance.&rdquo; He then
repeated a magic formula that he had learned, and snapped his fingers.
The three devils seemed to be afraid of this. Then Man-ji suddenly
closed his fist and struck a blow at the first devil. It dodged,
however, most deftly and he missed, but hit the floor a sounding blow
that cut his hand.</p>
<p>Then they all shouted, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go, we&rsquo;ll go, since
you treat guests thus.&rdquo; At once they bundled out of the room and
disappeared.</p>
<p>On the following day he had oxen killed and a sacrifice offered to
these devils, and they returned no more.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Men have been killed by goblins. This is not so
much due to the fact that goblins are wicked as to the fact that men
are afraid of them. Many died in North Ham-kyong, but those again who
were brave, and clove them with a knife, or struck them down, lived. If
they had been afraid, they too would have died.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Story</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Yon-nan County, Whang-hai Province, there was a
certain literary graduate whose name I have forgotten. He fell ill one
day and remained in his room, leaning helplessly against his arm-rest.
Suddenly several spirit soldiers appeared to him, saying, &ldquo;The
Governor of the lower hell has ordered your arrest,&rdquo; so they
bound him with a chain about his neck, and led him away. They journeyed
for many hundreds of miles, and at last reached a place that had a very
high wall. The spirits then took him within the walls and went on for a
long distance.</p>
<p>There was within this enclosure a great structure whose height
reached to heaven. They arrived at the gate, and the spirits who had
him in hand led him in, and when they entered the inner courtyard they
laid him down on his face.</p>
<p>Glancing up he saw what looked like a king seated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2615" href="#xd25e2615" name=
"xd25e2615">178</a>]</span>on a throne; grouped about him on each side
were attendant officers. There were also scores of secretaries and
soldiers going and coming on pressing errands. The King&rsquo;s
appearance was most terrible, and his commands such as to fill one with
awe. The graduate felt the perspiration break out on his back, and he
dared not look up. In a little a secretary came forward, stood in front
of the raised dais to transmit commands, and the King asked,
&ldquo;Where do you come from? What is your name? How old are you? What
do you do for a living? Tell me the truth now, and no
dissembling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scholar, frightened to death, replied, &ldquo;My clan name is
So-and-so, and my given name is So-and-so. I am so old, and I have
lived for several generations at Yon-nan, Whang-hai Province. I am
stupid and ill-equipped by nature, so have not done anything special. I
have heard all my life that if you say your beads with love and pity in
your heart you will escape hell, and so have given my time to calling
on the Buddha, and dispensing alms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The secretary, hearing this, went at once and reported it to the
King. After some time he came back with a message, saying, &ldquo;Come
up closer to the steps, for you are not the person intended. It happens
that you bear the same name and you have thus been wrongly arrested.
You may go now.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2621" href=
"#xd25e2621" name="xd25e2621">179</a>]</span></p>
<p>The scholar joined his hands and made a deep bow. Again the
secretary transmitted a message from the King, saying, &ldquo;My house,
when on earth, was in such a place in such and such a ward of Seoul.
When you go back I want to send a message by you. My coming here is
long, and the outer coat I wear is worn to shreds. Ask my people to
send me a new outer coat. If you do so I shall be greatly obliged, so
see that you do not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scholar said, &ldquo;Your Majesty&rsquo;s message given me thus
direct I shall pass on without fail, but the ways of the two worlds,
the dark world and the light, are so different that when I give the
message the hearers will say I am talking nonsense. True, I&rsquo;ll
give it just as you have commanded, but what about it if they refuse to
listen? I ought to have some evidence as proof to help me
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The King made answer, &ldquo;Your words are true, very true. This
will help you: When I was on earth,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one of my
head buttons<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2628src" href="#xd25e2628"
name="xd25e2628src">1</a> that I wore had a broken edge, and I hid it
in the third volume of the Book of History. I alone know of it, no one
else in the world. If you give this as a proof they will
listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scholar replied, &ldquo;That will be satisfactory, but again,
how shall I do in case they make the new coat?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2633" href="#xd25e2633" name=
"xd25e2633">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>The reply was, &ldquo;Prepare a sacrifice, offer the coat by fire,
and it will reach me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then bade good-bye, and the King sent with him two soldier
guards. He asked the soldiers, as they came out, who the one seated on
the throne was. &ldquo;He is the King of Hades,&rdquo; said they;
&ldquo;his surname is Pak and his given name is Oo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They arrived at the bank of a river, and the two soldiers pushed him
into the water. He awoke with a start, and found that he had been dead
for three days.</p>
<p>When he recovered from his sickness he came up to Seoul, searched
out the house indicated, and made careful inquiry as to the name,
finding that it was no other than Pak Oo. Pak Oo had two sons, who at
that time had graduated and were holding office. The graduate wanted to
see the sons of this King of Hades, but the gatekeeper would not let
him in. Therefore he stood before the red gate waiting helplessly till
the sun went down. Then came out from the inner quarters of the house
an old servant, to whom he earnestly made petition that he might see
the master. On being thus requested, the servant returned and reported
it to the master, who, a little later, ordered him in. On entering, he
saw two gentlemen who seemed to be chiefs. They had him sit down, and
then questioned him as to who he was and what he had to say.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2643" href="#xd25e2643" name=
"xd25e2643">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;I am a student living in Yon-nan County,
Whang-hai Province. On such and such a day I died and went into the
other world, where your honorable father gave me such and such a
commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two listened for a little and then, without waiting to hear all
that he had to say, grew very angry and began to scold him, saying,
&ldquo;How dare such a scarecrow as you come into our house and say
such things as these? This is stuff and nonsense that you talk. Pitch
him out,&rdquo; they shouted to the servants.</p>
<p>He, however, called back saying, &ldquo;I have a proof; listen. If
it fails, why then, pitch me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the two said, &ldquo;What possible proof can you have?&rdquo;
Then the scholar told with great exactness and care the story of the
head button.</p>
<p>The two, in astonishment over this, had the book taken down and
examined, and sure enough in Vol. III of the Book of History was the
button referred to. Not a single particular had failed. It proved to be
a button that they had missed after the death of their father, and that
they had searched for in vain.</p>
<p>Accepting the message now as true, they all entered upon a period of
mourning.</p>
<p>The women of the family also called in the scholar and asked him
specially of what he had seen. So they made the outer coat, chose a
day, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2658" href="#xd25e2658"
name="xd25e2658">182</a>]</span>offered it by fire before the ancestral
altar. Three days after the sacrifice the scholar dreamed, and the
family of Pak dreamed too, that the King of Hades had come and given to
each one of them his thanks for the coat. They long kept the scholar at
their home, treating him with great respect, and became his firm
friends for ever after.</p>
<p>Pak Oo was a great-grandson of Minister Pak Chom. While he held
office he was honest and just and was highly honoured by the people.
When he was Mayor of Hai-ju there arose a dispute between him and the
Governor, which proved also that Pak was the honest man.</p>
<p>When I was at Hai-ju, Choi Yu-chom, a graduate, told me this
story.</p>

<h2 class="main">HONG&rsquo;S EXPERIENCES IN HADES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Hong Nai-pom was a military graduate who was born in
the year <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 1561, and lived in the city of
Pyeng-yang. He passed his examination in the year 1603, and in the year
1637 attained to the Third Degree. He was 82 in the year 1643, and his
son Sonn memorialized the King asking that his father be given rank
appropriate to his age. At that time a certain Han Hong-kil was chief
of the Royal Secretaries, and he refused to pass on the request to his
Majesty; but in the year 1644, when the Crown Prince was returning from
his exile in China, he came by way of Pyeng-yang. Sonn took advantage
of this to present the same request to the Crown Prince. His Highness
received it, and had it brought to the notice of the King. In
consequence, Hong received the rank of Second Degree.</p>
<p>On receiving it he said, &ldquo;This year I shall die,&rdquo; and a
little later he died.</p>
<p>In the year 1594, Hong fell ill of typhus fever, and after ten days
of suffering, died. They prepared his body for burial, and placed it in
a coffin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2684" href="#xd25e2684"
name="xd25e2684">184</a>]</span>Then the friends and relatives left,
and his wife remained alone in charge. Of a sudden the body turned
itself and fell with a thud to the ground. The woman, frightened,
fainted away, and the other members of the family came rushing to her
help. From this time on the body resumed its functions, and Hong
lived.</p>
<p>Said he, &ldquo;In my dream I went to a certain region, a place of
great fear where many persons were standing around, and awful ogres,
some of them wearing bulls&rsquo; heads, and some with faces of wild
beasts. They crowded about and jumped and pounced toward me in all
directions. A scribe robed in black sat on a platform and addressed me,
saying, &lsquo;There are three religions on earth, Confucianism,
Buddhism and Taoism. According to Buddhism, you know that heaven and
hell are places that decide between man&rsquo;s good and evil deeds.
You have ever been a blasphemer of the Buddha, and a denier of a future
life, acting always as though you knew everything, blustering and
storming. You are now to be sent to hell, and ten thousand
kalpas<a class="noteref" id="xd25e2688src" href="#xd25e2688" name=
"xd25e2688src">1</a> will not see you out of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then two or three constables carrying spears came and took me
off. I screamed, &lsquo;You are wrong, I am innocently
condemned.&rsquo; Just at that moment a certain Buddha, with a face of
shining <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2695" href="#xd25e2695"
name="xd25e2695">185</a>]</span>gold, came smiling toward me, and said,
&lsquo;There is truly a mistake somewhere; this man must attain to the
age of eighty-three and become an officer of the Second Degree ere he
dies.&rsquo; Then addressing me he asked, &lsquo;How is it that you
have come here? The order was that a certain Hong of Chon-ju be
arrested and brought, not you; but now that you have come, look about
the place before you go, and tell the world afterwards of what you have
seen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guards, on hearing this, took me in hand and brought me
first to a prison-house, where a sign was posted up, marked,
&lsquo;Stirrers up of Strife.&rsquo; I saw in this prison a great
brazier-shaped pit, built of stones and filled with fire. Flames arose
and forked tongues. The stirrers up of strife were taken and made to
sit close before it. I then saw one infernal guard take a long rod of
iron, heat it red-hot, and put out the eyes of the guilty ones. I saw
also that the offenders were hung up like dried fish. The guides who
accompanied me, said, &lsquo;While these were on earth they did not
love their brethren, but looked at others as enemies. They scoffed at
the laws of God and sought only selfish gain, so they are
punished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next hell was marked, &lsquo;Liars.&rsquo; In that hell I
saw an iron pillar of several yards in height, and great stones placed
before it. The offenders were called up, and made to kneel before the
pillar. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2701" href="#xd25e2701"
name="xd25e2701">186</a>]</span>Then I saw an executioner take a knife
and drive a hole through the tongues of the offenders, pass an iron
chain through each, and hang them to the pillar so that they dangled by
their tongues several feet from the ground. A stone was then taken and
tied to each culprit&rsquo;s feet. The stones thus bearing down, and
the chains being fast to the pillar, their tongues were pulled out a
foot or more, and their eyes rolled in their sockets. Their agonies
were appalling. The guides again said, &lsquo;These offenders when on
earth used their tongues skilfully to tell lies and to separate friend
from friend, and so they are punished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next hell had inscribed on it, &lsquo;Deceivers.&rsquo; I
saw in it many scores of people. There were ogres that cut the flesh
from their bodies, and fed it to starving demons. These ate and ate,
and the flesh was cut and cut till only the bones remained. When the
winds of hell blew, flesh returned to them; then metal snakes and
copper dogs crowded in to bite them and suck their blood. Their screams
of pain made the earth to tremble. The guides said to me, &lsquo;When
these offenders were on earth they held high office, and while they
pretended to be true and good they received bribes in secret and were
doers of all evil. As Ministers of State they ate the fat of the land
and sucked the blood of the people, and yet advertised themselves
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2705" href="#xd25e2705" name=
"xd25e2705">187</a>]</span>as benefactors and were highly applauded.
While in reality they lived as thieves, they pretended to be holy, as
Confucius and Mencius are holy. They were deceivers of the world, and
robbers, and so are punished thus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guides then said, &lsquo;It is not necessary that you see
all the hells.&rsquo; They said to one another, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s take
him yonder and show him;&rsquo; so they went some distance to the
south-east. There was a great house with a sign painted thus,
&lsquo;The Home of the Blessed.&rsquo; As I looked, there were
beautiful haloes encircling it, and clouds of glory. There were
hundreds of priests in cassock and surplice. Some carried fresh-blown
lotus flowers; some were seated like the Buddha; some were reading
prayers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guides said, &lsquo;These when on earth kept the faith,
and with undivided hearts served the Buddha, and so have escaped the
Eight Sorrows and the Ten Punishments, and are now in the home of the
happy, which is called heaven.&rsquo; When we had seen all these things
we returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The golden-faced Buddha said to me, &lsquo;Not many on earth
believe in the Buddha, and few know of heaven and hell. What do you
think of it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bowed low and thanked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the black-coated scribe said, &lsquo;I am sending this
man away; see him safely off.&rsquo; The spirit soldiers took me with
them, and while on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2718" href=
"#xd25e2718" name="xd25e2718">188</a>]</span>way I awakened with a
start, and found that I had been dead for four days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hong&rsquo;s mind was filled with pride on this account, and he
frequently boasted of it. His age and Second Degree of rank came about
just as the Buddha had predicted.</p>
<p>His experience, alas! was used as a means to deceive people, for the
Superior Man does not talk of these strange and wonderful things.</p>
<p>Yi Tan, a Chinaman of the Song Kingdom, used to say, &ldquo;If there
is no heaven, there is no heaven, but if there is one, the Superior Man
alone can attain to it. If there is no hell, there is no hell, but if
there is one the bad man must inherit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we examine Hong&rsquo;s story, while it looks like a yarn to
deceive the world, it really is a story to arouse one to right action.
I, Im Bang, have recorded it like Toi-chi, saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
find fault with the story, but learn its lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="main">HAUNTED HOUSES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There once lived a man in Seoul called Yi Chang, who
frequently told as an experience of his own the following story: He was
poor and had no home of his own, so he lived much in quarters loaned
him by others. When hard pressed he even went into haunted houses and
lived there. Once, after failing to find a place, he heard of one such
house in Ink Town (one of the wards of Seoul), at the foot of South
Mountain, which had been haunted for generations and was now left
vacant. Chang investigated the matter, and finally decided to take
possession.</p>
<p>First, to find whether it was really haunted or not, he called his
elder brothers, Hugh and Haw, and five or six of his relatives, and had
them help clean it out and sleep there. The house had one upper room
that was fast locked. Looking through a chink, there was seen to be in
the room a tablet chair and a stand for it; also there was an old harp
without any strings, a pair of worn shoes, and some <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2742" href="#xd25e2742" name=
"xd25e2742">190</a>]</span>sticks and bits of wood. Nothing else was in
the room. Dust lay thick, as though it had gathered through long years
of time.</p>
<p>The company, after drinking wine, sat round the table and played at
games, watching the night through. When it was late, towards midnight,
they suddenly heard the sound of harps and a great multitude of voices,
though the words were mixed and unintelligible. It was as though many
people were gathered and carousing at a feast. The company then
consulted as to what they should do. One drew a sword and struck a hole
through the partition that looked into the tower. Instantly there
appeared from the other side a sharp blade thrust out towards them. It
was blue in colour. In fear and consternation they desisted from
further interference with the place. But the sound of the harp and the
revelry kept up till the morning. The company broke up at daylight,
withdrew from the place, and never again dared to enter.</p>
<p>In the South Ward there was another haunted house, of which Chang
desired possession, so he called his friends and brothers once more to
make the experiment and see whether it was really haunted or not. On
entering, they found two dogs within the enclosure, one black and one
tan, lying upon the open verandah, one at each end. Their eyes were
fiery red, and though the company <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e2748" href="#xd25e2748" name="xd25e2748">191</a>]</span>shouted
at them they did not move. They neither barked nor bit. But when
midnight came these two animals got up and went down into the court,
and began baying at the inky sky in a way most ominous. They went
jumping back and forth. At that time, too, there came some one round
the corner of the house dressed in ceremonial robes. The two dogs met
him with great delight, jumping up before and behind in their joy at
his coming. He ascended to the verandah, and sat down. Immediately five
or six multi-coloured demons appeared and bowed before him, in front of
the open space. The man then led the demons and the dogs two or three
times round the house. They rushed up into the verandah and jumped down
again into the court; backwards and forwards they came and went, till
at last all of them mysteriously disappeared. The devils went into a
hole underneath the floor, while the dogs went up to their quarters and
lay down.</p>
<p>The company from the inner room had seen this. When daylight came
they examined the place, looked through the chinks of the floor, but
saw only an old, worn-out sieve and a few discarded brooms. They went
behind the house and found another old broom poked into the chimney.
They ordered a servant to gather them up and have them burned. The dogs
lay as they were all day long, and neither ate nor moved. Some of the
party <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2752" href="#xd25e2752" name=
"xd25e2752">192</a>]</span>wished to kill the brutes, but were afraid,
so fearsome was their appearance.</p>
<p>This night again they remained, desiring to see if the same
phenomena would appear. Again at midnight the two dogs got down into
the court and began barking up at the sky. The man in ceremonial robes
again came, and the devils, just as the day before.</p>
<p>The company, in fear and disgust, left the following morning, and
did not try it again.</p>
<p>A friend, hearing this of Chang, went and asked about it from Hugh
and Haw, and they confirmed the story.</p>
<p>There is still another tale of a graduate who was out of house and
home and went into a haunted dwelling in Ink Town, which was said to
have had the tower where the mysterious sounds were heard. They opened
the door, broke out the window, took out the old harp, the spirit
chair, the shoes and sticks, and had them burned. Before the fire had
finished its work, one of the servants fell down and died. The
graduate, seeing this, in fear and dismay put out the fire, restored
the things and left the house.</p>
<p>Again there was another homeless man who tried it. In the night a
woman in a blue skirt came down from the loft, and acted in a peculiar
and uncanny way. The man, seeing this, picked up his belongings and
left. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2765" href="#xd25e2765" name=
"xd25e2765">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>Again, in South Kettle Town, there were a number of woodmen who in
the early morning were passing behind the haunted house, when they
found an old woman sitting weeping under a tree. They thinking her an
evil bogey, one man came up behind and gave her a thrust with his
sickle. The witch rushed off into the house, her height appearing to be
only about one cubit and a span.</p>

<p class="first">[Im Kyong-up.&mdash;One of Korea&rsquo;s most famous
generals, who fought in behalf of China in 1628 against the Manchus. He
is worshipped to-day in many parts of Korea.]</p>
<div class="div2 story"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main"><i>The Story</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When General Im Kyong-up was young he lived in the
town of Tallai. In those days he loved the chase, and constantly
practised riding and hunting. Once he went off on an excursion to track
the deer in Wol-lak Mountains. He carried only a sword, and made the
chase on foot. In his pursuit of the animal he went as far as Tai-paik
Mountain. There night overtook him, and the way was hidden in the
darkness. There were yawning chasms and great horns and cliffs on all
sides. While he was in a state of perplexity he met a woodman, and
asked him where the road was and how he ought to go. The woodman
directed him to a cliff opposite, &ldquo;where,&rdquo; said he,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2786" href="#xd25e2786" name=
"xd25e2786">195</a>]</span>&ldquo;there is a house.&rdquo; Im heard
this and crossed over to the farther ridge. On approaching more nearly
he found a great tiled mansion standing alone without a single house
about it. He went in by the main gateway, but found all quiet and dark
and no one in sight. It was a vacant house, evidently deserted. After
travelling all day in the hills Im was full of fears and creepy
feelings. So he viewed the place with mistrust, fearing that there
might be hill goblins in it or tree devils, but a moment later some one
opened the room door and shouted out, &ldquo;Do you sleep here? Have
you had something to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Im looked and discovered that it was the same person that had
directed him on his way. He said in reply, &ldquo;I have not eaten
anything and am hungry.&rdquo; So the man opened the wall box and
brought him out wine and meat. He, being exceedingly hungry, ate all.
Then they sat down to talk together, and after a little the woodman got
up, opened the box once more, and took from it a great sword. Im asked,
&ldquo;What is this you have; do you intend to kill me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woodman laughed and said, &ldquo;No, no, but to-night there is
something on hand worth the seeing. Will you come with me and not be
afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Im said, &ldquo;Of course I am not afraid; I want to see.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2794" href="#xd25e2794" name=
"xd25e2794">196</a>]</span></p>
<p>It was then about midnight, and the woodman, with the sword in his
hand, took Im and went to one side through a succession of gates that
seemed never ending. At last they came to a place where lights were
reflected on a pond of water. There was a high pavilion apparently in
the middle of the lake, and from the inside of it came the lights.
There were sounds, too, of laughter and talking that came from the
upper storey. Through the sliding doors he could distinguish two people
seated together. There was another pavilion to the right of the lake
and a large tree near it, up which the woodman told Im to climb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you get well up,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take your belt,
tie yourself fast to the trunk and keep perfectly still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Im climbed the tree as directed, and made himself secure. From this
point of vantage he looked intently, and the first thing he saw was the
woodman give a leap that cleared the lake and landed him in the
pavilion. At once he ascended to the upper storey, and now Im could
distinguish three persons sitting talking and laughing. He heard the
woodman, after drinking, say to his neighbour, &ldquo;We have made our
wager, now let&rsquo;s see it out.&rdquo; The man replied,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do so.&rdquo; Then both arose, came down to the
entrance, and vaulted off into mid-air, where they disappeared from
sight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2801" href="#xd25e2801" name=
"xd25e2801">197</a>]</span>Nothing could be distinguished now but the
clashing of steel and flashes of fire, which kept up for a long
time.</p>
<p>In beholding this from the tree top, where he was stationed, his
bones grew cold and his hair stood stiff on end. He knew not what to
do. Then a moment later he heard something fall to the ground with a
great thud. A cry of victory arose too, and he recognized that it was
the woodman&rsquo;s voice. Chills ran all over him, and goose-flesh
covered his skin; only after a long time could he gain control of
himself. He came down from the tree and the woodman met him, took him
suddenly under his arm, and vaulted over into the pavilion. Here he met
a beautiful woman with hair like fleecy clouds. Before the fight the
woman&rsquo;s voice was evidently full of hilarity, but now she was
overcome with grief and tears.</p>
<p>The woodman spoke roughly to her, saying, &ldquo;Do you not know
that you, a wicked woman, have caused the death of a great man?&rdquo;
The woodman said also to Im, &ldquo;You have courage and valour in your
way, but it is not sufficient to meet a world like this. I will now
give you this woman, and this house, so you can bid farewell to the
dusty world and live here in peace and quiet for the rest of your
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Im replied, &ldquo;What I have seen to-night I am at <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2809" href="#xd25e2809" name=
"xd25e2809">198</a>]</span>a loss to understand. I&rsquo;d like to know
the meaning of it first; please tell me. After hearing that I&rsquo;ll
do what you ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woodman said, &ldquo;I am not an ordinary mortal of the world,
but am an outlaw of the hills and woods. I am a robber, really, and by
robbing have many such a house as this. Not only here but in all the
provinces I have homes abundant, a beautiful woman in each, and rich
and dainty fare. All unexpectedly this woman has neglected me for
another man, and he and she have several times tried to kill me. There
being no help for it, I had to kill him. I have killed the man, but I
ought truly to have killed the woman. Take this place, then, off my
hands, will you, and the woman too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Im asked, &ldquo;Who was the man, and where did he
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were,&rdquo; said the woodman, &ldquo;mighty
possibilities in him, though he lived humbly inside the South Gate of
Seoul and sold cut tobacco. He came here frequently, and I knew it,
though I winked at it all until they attempted to kill me, and that
brought matters to a head. It was not my wish to kill him,&rdquo; and
here the woodman broke down and cried. &ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I have killed a great and gifted man. Think it over,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;you have courage, but not enough to make any mark in
the world. You will fail half-way, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e2818" href="#xd25e2818" name="xd25e2818">199</a>]</span>the Fates
have so decided. Cease from any vain ambitions, for there is no way by
which your name can ever become famous. Do what I say, then, and take
over this woman and this home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Im, however, shook his head and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woodman asked, &ldquo;Why can you not? If you do not, there is
nothing for this woman but death, so here I&rsquo;ll have done with
it,&rdquo; and he struck her with his sword and cut off her head.</p>
<p>The day following he said to Im, &ldquo;Since you are determined to
go forth and do valiantly, I cannot stop you, but if a man goes forth
thus and does not know the use of the sword he is helpless, and at the
mercy of the foe. Stay with me a little and learn. I&rsquo;ll teach
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Im stayed for six days and learned the use of the sword.</p>

<h2 class="label">XXXVIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE MAGIC INVASION OF SEOUL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A gentleman of Seoul was one day crossing the Han
River in a boat. In the crossing, he nodded for a moment, fell asleep
and dreamed a dream. In his dream he met a man who had Gothic eyebrows
and almond eyes, whose face was red as ripened dates, and whose height
was eight cubits and a span. He was dressed in green and had a long
beard that came down to his belt-string. A man of majestic appearance
he was, with a great sword at his side and he rode on a red horse.</p>
<p>He asked the gentleman to open his hand, which he did, and then the
august stranger dashed a pen-mark on it as the sign of the God of War.
Said he, &ldquo;When you cross the river, do not go direct to Seoul,
but wait at the landing. Seven horses will shortly appear, loaded with
network hampers, all proceeding on their journey to the capital. You
are to call the horsemen, open your hand, and show them the sign. When
they see it they will all commit suicide in your very presence. After
that, you are to take the loads and pile them up, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2842" href="#xd25e2842" name=
"xd25e2842">201</a>]</span>don&rsquo;t look into them. Then you are to
go at once and report the matter to the Palace and have them all
burned. The matter is of immense importance, so do not fail in the
slightest particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman gave a great start of terror and awoke. He looked at
his hand and there, indeed, was the strange mark. Not only so, but the
ink had not yet dried upon it. He was astonished beyond measure, but
did as the dream had indicated, and waited on the river&rsquo;s bank.
In a little there came, as he was advised, the seven loads on seven
horses, coming from the far-distant South. There were attendants in
charge, and one man wearing an official coat came along behind. When
they had crossed the river the gentleman called them to him and said,
&ldquo;I have something to say to you; come close to me.&rdquo; These
men, unsuspecting, though with somewhat of a frightened look, closed
up. He then showed them his hand with the mark, and asked them if they
knew what it was. When they saw it, first of all, the man in the
official coat turned and with one bound jumped over the cliff into the
river. The eight or nine who accompanied the loads likewise all rushed
after him and dashed into the water.</p>
<p>The scholar then called the boatmen, and explained to them that the
things in the hampers were dangerous, that he would have to make it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2848" href="#xd25e2848" name=
"xd25e2848">202</a>]</span>known to the Palace, and that in the
meantime they were to keep close guard, but that they were not to touch
them or look at them.</p>
<p>He hurried as fast as possible, and reported the matter to the Board
of War. The Board sent an official, and had the loads brought into
Seoul, and then, as had been directed, they were piled high with wood
and set on fire. When the fire developed, the baskets broke open, and
little figures of men and horses, each an inch or so long, in countless
numbers, came tumbling out.</p>
<p>When the officials saw this they were frozen with fear; their hearts
ceased beating and their tongues lolled out. In a little, however, the
hampers were all burned up.</p>
<p>These were the creation of a magician, and were intended for a
monster invasion of Seoul, until warned by Kwan.</p>
<p>From that time on the people of Seoul began faithful offerings to
the God of War, for had he not saved the city?</p>

<h2 class="label">XXXIX</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE AWFUL LITTLE GOBLIN</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was an occasion for a celebration in the home of
a nobleman of Seoul, whereupon a feast, to which were invited all the
family friends, was prepared. There was a great crowd of men and women.
In front of the women&rsquo;s quarters there suddenly appeared an
uncombed, ugly-looking boy about fifteen years of age. The host and
guests, thinking him a coolie who had come in the train of some
visitor, did not ask specially concerning him, but one of the women
guests, seeing him in the inner quarters, sent a servant to reprimand
him and put him out. The boy, however, did not move, so the servant
said to him, &ldquo;Who are you, anyway, and with whom did you come,
that you enter the women&rsquo;s quarters, and even when told to go out
do not go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy, however, stood stock-still, just as he had been, with no
word of reply.</p>
<p>The company looked at him in doubt, and began to ask one another
whose he was and with whom <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2874"
href="#xd25e2874" name="xd25e2874">204</a>]</span>he had come. Again
they had the servant make inquiry, but still there was no reply. The
women then grew very angry, and ordered him to be put out. Several took
hold of him and tried to pull him, but he was like a fixed rock, fast
in the earth, absolutely immovable. In helpless rage they informed the
men.</p>
<p>The men, hearing this, sent several strong servants, who took hold
all at once, but he did not budge a hair. They asked, &ldquo;Who are
you, anyway?&rdquo; but he gave no reply. The crowd, then enraged, sent
ten strong men with ropes to bind him, but like a giant mountain he
remained fast, so that they recognized that he could not be moved by
man&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>One guest remarked, &ldquo;But he, too, is human; why cannot he be
moved?&rdquo; They then sent five or six giant fellows with clubs to
smash him to pieces, and they laid on with all their might. It looked
as though he would be crushed like an egg-shell, while the sound of
their pounding was like reverberating thunder. But just as before, not
a hair did he turn, not a wink did he give.</p>
<p>Then the crowd began to fear, saying, &ldquo;This is not a man, but
a god,&rdquo; so they entered the courtyard, one and all, and began to
bow before him, joining their hands and supplicating earnestly. They
kept this up for a long time. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2882"
href="#xd25e2882" name="xd25e2882">205</a>]</span></p>
<p>At last the boy gave a sarcastic smile, turned round, went out of
the gate and disappeared.</p>
<p>The company, frightened out of their wits, called off the feast.
From that day on, the people of that house were taken ill, including
host and guests. Those who scolded him, those who tied him with ropes,
those who pounded him, all died in a few days. Other members of the
company, too, contracted typhus and the like, and died also.</p>
<p>It was commonly held that the boy was the Too-uk Spirit, but we
cannot definitely say. Strange, indeed!</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;When the time comes for a clan to disappear from
the earth, calamity befalls it. Even though a great spirit should come
in at the door at such a feast time, if the guests had done as
Confucius suggests, &ldquo;Be reverent and distant,&rdquo; instead of
insulting him and making him more malignant than ever, they would have
escaped. Still, devils and men were never intended to dwell
together.</p>

why do you not strike dead this wicked man who beats his
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The beating over, the son thrust his sickle through his belt and
went slowly off to the fields where he was engaged by a neighbour in
reaping buckwheat. The day was fine, and the sky beautifully clear.
Suddenly a dark fleck of cloud appeared in mid-heaven, and a little
later all the sky became black. Furious thunder followed, and rain came
on. The village people looked out toward the field, where the flashes
of lightning were specially noticeable. They seemed to see there a man
with lifted sickle trying to ward them off. When the storm had cleared
away, they went to see, and lo, they found the man who <span class=

bowed low, and in tears said, &ldquo;Sir, Minister Hong wishes to kill
off me and all my posterity. Please save me, won&rsquo;t

<p>Kwon asked, &ldquo;How can I save you?&rdquo; The old man replied,
&ldquo;Hong will assuredly ask Your Excellency to help him. Desist from
it, please, for if you do, Hong will give it up and I shall live and
all mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later there came a rap at the door, when Kwon awakened and

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a priest called Namnu who had perfected
his ways in the Buddhistic doctrine. Whenever he had clothing of his
own he would willingly undress and give it to those who were cold. His
spirit was gentle with no creases or corners in it. Everybody, high and
low, rich and poor, called him by the nickname of Softy. Whenever he
saw any one sentenced to a flogging in the temple or official
<i>yamen</i>, Namnu invariably begged that he might take the
culprit&rsquo;s place. Once, when there was a great function in
progress at Pagoda Temple and many high officials were assembled,
Softy, too, was seen kneeling at the side and taking part. He suddenly
remarked to Prince Hong of Yon-san, &ldquo;You are indeed a very great
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hong replied, &ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;great man,&rsquo;
you impudent brat? Take that,&rdquo; and he gave him a box with his
fist on the ear. Softy laughed, and said, &ldquo;Please, Hong,
don&rsquo;t do that, it hurts! it hurts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later I was in the train of Prince Yi of Yun-song, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2952" href="#xd25e2952" name=

we stopped for a little before the Temple. Softy was there, and he
looked at Yi and said, &ldquo;I know your face, but I have forgotten
your name.&rdquo; Afterwards he said, &ldquo;Oh, I remember now, you
are Yi Sok-hyong.&rdquo; The priests of the monastery who heard this
familiarity were scandalized, and hurried to make no end of apology to
the Prince, saying, &ldquo;Softy was born so, God made him so. Please,
Your Excellency, forgive him.&rdquo; The Prince forgave him and so he
was not disturbed.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">People say that when the magpie builds its nest
directly south of a home that the master of the house will be promoted
in office. King T&rsquo;ai-jong had a friend once who was very poor and
had failed in all his projects. After various fruitless attempts he
decided to wait till the King went out on procession and then to send a
servant to build an imitation magpie&rsquo;s nest in some propitious
place before him. The King saw it and asked the man what he was doing.
He said in reply that when a magpie builds its nest straight south of a
home the master of the house instantly gets promotion. His master, he
said, had waited so long and nothing had come, that he was building an
imitation nest to bring it about. The King took pity on him and ordered
his appointment at once.</p>
<p>When I was young myself a magpie built its nest before our home, but
I, along with other boys, cut off the branch so that the whole nest
fell to the ground, and there were the young with their pitiful yellow
mouths. I felt sorry and afraid that they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e2968" href="#xd25e2968" name="xd25e2968">213</a>]</span>would
die, so on a propitious site to the south I had the nest hung up on a
<i>neutie</i> tree, where the young all lived and flourished and flew
away. In that very winter my father was promoted three degrees in rank
and was attached to the office of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Afterwards I built a summer-house at Chong-pa, and before the house,
directly facing south, magpies built a nest in a date tree. I had a
woman slave, and she pulled it down and used the nest for fuel, but
they came again the next year and built once more. The year following
was 1469 when Ye-jong came to the throne. That year again I was
promoted. In the spring of 1471 magpies came and built their nest in a
tree just south of my office. I laughed and said, &ldquo;There is a
spiritual power in the magpie surely, as men have said from olden times
and as I myself have proven.&rdquo;</p>

his mother. With a single horse and one servant he made a journey to
the south where the road led through the county of Kai-ryong. At that
very time two or three of the district magistrates had pitched a tent
on the bank of the river and were having refreshments. They said to one
another, &ldquo;Who is that mourner that goes riding by without
dismounting? It must be some country farmer who has never learned
proper manners. We shall certainly have to teach him a
lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sent an attendant to arrest and bring his servant, whom they
asked, &ldquo;Who is your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replied, &ldquo;Choi, the Old Buddha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s his real name?&rdquo; they demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old Buddha,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>Then they grew very angry at this, and said, &ldquo;Your master has
offended in not dismounting, and you offend in concealing his name.
Both slave and master are equally ill-mannered.&rdquo; And so they beat
him over the head. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e2997" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Prince Ha had a slave who was a landed proprieter and
lived in Yang-ju county. He had a daughter, fairest of the fair, whom
he called <i>Mo</i> (Nobody), beautiful beyond expression. An Yun was a
noted scholar, a man of distinction in letters. He saw Mo, fell in love
with her and took her for his wife. Prince Ha heard of this and was
furiously angry. Said he, &ldquo;How is it that you, a slave, dare to
marry with a man of the aristocracy?&rdquo; He had her arrested and
brought home, intending to marry her to one of his bondsmen. Mo learned
of this with tears and sorrow, but knew not what to do. At last she
made her escape over the wall and went back to An. An was delighted
beyond expression to see her; but, in view of the old prince, he knew
not what to do. Together they took an oath to die rather than to be
parted.</p>
<p>Later Prince Ha, on learning of this, sent his underlings to arrest
her again and carry her off. After this all trace of her was lost till
Mo was discovered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3035" href=
"#xd25e3035" name="xd25e3035">218</a>]</span>one day in a room hanging
by the neck dead.</p>
<p>Months of sorrow passed over An till once, under cover of the night,
he was returning from the Confucian Temple to his house over the ridge
of Camel Mountain. It was early autumn and the wooded tops were
shimmering in the moonlight. All the world had sunk softly to rest and
no passers were on the way. An was just then musing longingly of Mo,
and in heartbroken accents repeating love verses to her memory, when
suddenly a soft footfall was heard as though coming from among the
pines. He took careful notice and there was Mo. An knew that she was
long dead, and so must have known that it was her spirit, but because
he was so buried in thought of her, doubting nothing, he ran to her and
caught her by the hand, saying, &ldquo;How did you come here?&rdquo;
but she disappeared. An gave a great cry and broke into tears. On
account of this he fell ill. He ate, but his grief was so great he
could not swallow, and a little later he died of a broken heart.</p>
<p>Kim Champan, who was of the same age as I, and my special friend,
was also a cousin of An, and he frequently spoke of this. Yu Hyo-jang,
also, An&rsquo;s nephew by marriage, told the story many times. Said
he, &ldquo;Faithful unto death was she. For even a woman of the
<i>literati</i>, who has been born <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

brought up at the gates of ceremonial form, it is a difficult matter
enough to die, but for a slave, the lowest of the low, who knew not the
first thing of Ceremony, Righteousness, Truth or Devotion, what about
her? To the end, out of love for her husband, she held fast to her
purity and yielded up her life without a blemish. Even of the faithful
among the ancients was there ever a better than Mo?&rdquo;</p>

dressed in plain clothes, started south on a long journey. On the way
he was overtaken by rain, and turned into a side pavilion for rest and
shelter. There was a young scholar already in the pavilion by the name
of Whang Eui-hon, who with his two hands behind his back was reading
the pavilion inscription board, on which verses were written. Long he
read and long he looked about as though no one else were there. At last
he turned to the old man, and said, &ldquo;Well, grand-dad, do you know
the flavour of verses like these?&rdquo; The famous Minister,
pretending ignorance, arose and said, &ldquo;An old countryman like
myself, could you expect him to know? Please tell me the
meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whang said, &ldquo;These verses were written by the great men of the
past. What they saw and experienced they wrote down to inspire the
souls of those who were to come after them. They are like pictures
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3060" href="#xd25e3060" name=

pictures in poetry, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Minister said, &ldquo;Indeed, that&rsquo;s wonderful; but if it
were not for men like yourself how should I ever come to know these
things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later came pack-horses loaded with all sorts of things;
servants and retainers, too, a great company of them, tent poles,
canvas packs and other equipment, a long procession.</p>
<p>Whang, surprised by this, made inquiry, when, to his amazement, he
learned that the old man was none other than Maing Sa-song.
Unconsciously he dropped on to his knees in a deep and long obeisance.
The Minister laughed and said, &ldquo;That will do; there is no
difference in the value of mere men, they are high or low according to
the thoughts that prompt them, but unfortunately all are born with a
proud heart. You are not a common scholar, why, therefore, should you
be so proud to begin with and so humble now?&rdquo; The Minister took
him by the hand, led him to his mat, made him sit down, comforted him
and sent him away.</p>

<p>His home was outside the South Gate, and every morning he was seen
kneeling on the sill of his front door beating his hands upwards and
downwards on his knees, and this practice he carried on for three
years. People could not imagine what he meant by it, but thought him
mad. Thus he learned the motions required for the harp.</p>
<p>Also he blew with his mouth and practised with his fingers day and
night without stopping, so that when people called on him he would see
them but would not perceive them. He kept this up for three years and
so learned the motions for the flute.</p>
<p>He was a lightly built man in body, and poor at riding and at
archery. He often sighed over this defect, and said, &ldquo;Though I am

<p class="first">[Sim Heui-su studied as a young man at the feet of No
Su-sin, who was sent as an exile to a distant island in the sea.
Thither he followed his master and worked at the Sacred Books. He
matriculated in 1570 and graduated in 1572. In 1589 he remonstrated
with King Son-jo over the disorders of his reign, and was the means of
quelling a great national disturbance; but he made a <i>faux pas</i>
one day when he said laughingly to a friend&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;These sea-gull waves ride so high,</p>
<p class="line xd25e2435">Who can tame them?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Those who heard caught at this, and it became a source
of unpopularity, as it indicated an unfavourable opinion of the
Court.</p>
<p>In 1592, when the King made his escape to Eui-ju, before the
invading Japanese army, he was the State&rsquo;s Chief Secretary, and
after the return of the King he became Chief Justice. He resigned
office, but the King refused to accept his resignation, saying,
&ldquo;I cannot do without you.&rdquo; He <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd25e3178" href="#xd25e3178" name="xd25e3178">232</a>]</span>became
chief of the <i>literati</i> and Special Adviser. Afterwards he became
Minister of the Right, then of the Left, at which time he wrote out ten
suggestions for His Majesty to follow. He saw the wrongs done around
the King, and resigned office again and again, but was constantly
recalled.</p>
<p>In 1608 Im Suk-yong, a young candidate writing for his
matriculation, wrote an essay exposing the wrongs of the Court. Sim
heard of this, and took the young man under his protection. The King,
reading the essay, was furiously angry, and ordered the degradation of
Im, but Sim said, &ldquo;He is with me; I am behind what he wrote and
approve; degrade me and not him,&rdquo; and so the King withdrew his
displeasure. He was faithful of the faithful.</p>
<p>When he was old he went and lived in Tun-san in a little tumble-down
hut, like the poorest of the <i>literati</i>. He called himself
&ldquo;Water-thunder Muddy-man,&rdquo; a name derived from the Book of
Changes.</p>
<p>He died in 1622 at the age of seventy-four, and is recorded as one
of Korea&rsquo;s great patriots.]</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Story</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Minister Sim Heui-su was, when young, handsome as
polished marble, and white as the snow, rarely and beautifully formed.
When eight years <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3198" href=
"#xd25e3198" name="xd25e3198">233</a>]</span>of age he was already an
adept at the character, and a wonder in the eyes of his people. The
boy&rsquo;s nickname was Soondong (the godlike one). From the passing
of his first examination, step by step he advanced, till at last he
became First Minister of the land. When old he was honoured as the most
renowned of all ministers. At seventy he still held office, and one
day, when occupied with the affairs of State, he suddenly said to those
about him, &ldquo;To-day is my last on earth, and my farewell wishes to
you all are that you may prosper and do bravely and well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His associates replied in wonder, &ldquo;Your Excellency is still
strong and hearty, and able for many years of work; why do you speak
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim laughingly made answer, &ldquo;Our span of life is fixed. Why
should I not know? We cannot pass the predestined limit. Please feel no
regret. Use all your efforts to serve His Majesty the King, and make
grateful acknowledgment of his many favours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he exhorted them, and took his departure. Every one wondered
over this strange announcement. From that day on he returned no more,
it being said that he was ailing.</p>
<p>There was at that time attached to the War Office a young secretary
directly under Sim. Hearing that his master was ill, the young man went
to pay <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3208" href="#xd25e3208" name=
"xd25e3208">234</a>]</span>his respects and to make inquiry. Sim called
him into his private room, where all was quiet. Said he, &ldquo;I am
about to die, and this is a long farewell, so take good care of
yourself, and do your part honourably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man looked, and in Sim&rsquo;s eyes were tears. He said,
&ldquo;Your Excellency is still vigorous, and even though you are
slightly ailing, there is surely no cause for anxiety. I am at a loss
to understand your tears, and what you mean by saying that you are
about to die. I would like to ask the reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim smiled and said, &ldquo;I have never told any person, but since
you ask and there is no longer cause for concealment, I shall tell you
the whole story. When I was young certain things happened in my life
that may make you smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At about sixteen years of age I was said to be a handsome boy
and fair to see. Once in Seoul, when a banquet was in progress and many
dancing-girls and other representatives of good cheer were called, I
went too, with a half-dozen comrades, to see. There was among the
dancing-girls a young woman whose face was very beautiful. She was not
like an earthly person, but like some angelic being. Inquiring as to
her name, some of those seated near said it was Ta-hong (Flower-bud).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3216" href="#xd25e3216" name=
"xd25e3216">235</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;When all was over and the guests had separated, I went home,
but I thought of Ta-hong&rsquo;s pretty face, and recalled her
repeatedly, over and over; seemingly I could not forget her. Ten days
or so later I was returning from my teacher&rsquo;s house along the
main street, carrying my books under my arm, when I suddenly met a
pretty girl, who was beautifully dressed and riding a handsome horse.
She alighted just in front of me, and to my surprise, taking my hand,
said, &lsquo;Are you not Sim Heui-su?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my astonishment I looked at her and saw that it was
Ta-hong. I said, &lsquo;Yes, but how do you know me?&rsquo; I was not
married then, nor had I my hair done up, and as there were many people
in the street looking on I was very much ashamed. Flower-bud, with a
look of gladness in her face, said to her pony-boy, &lsquo;I have
something to see to just now; you return and say to the master that I
shall be present at the banquet to-morrow.&rsquo; Then we went aside
into a neighbouring house and sat down. She said, &lsquo;Did you not on
such and such a day go to such and such a Minister&rsquo;s house and
look on at the gathering?&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;Yes, I did.&rsquo;
&lsquo;I saw you,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and to me your face was like
a god&rsquo;s. I asked those present who you were, and they said your
family name was Sim and your given-name Heui-su, and that your
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3221" href="#xd25e3221" name=
"xd25e3221">236</a>]</span>character and gifts were very superior. From
that day on I longed to meet you, but as there was no possibility of
this I could only think of you. Our meeting thus is surely of
God&rsquo;s appointment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I replied laughingly, &lsquo;I, too, felt just the same
towards you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Ta-hong said, &lsquo;We cannot meet here; let&rsquo;s go
to my aunt&rsquo;s home in the next ward, where it&rsquo;s quiet, and
talk there.&rsquo; We went to the aunt&rsquo;s home. It was neat and
clean and somewhat isolated, and apparently the aunt loved Flower-bud
with all the devotion of a mother. From that day forth we plighted our
troth together. Flower-bud had never had a lover; I was her first and
only choice. She said, however, &lsquo;This plan of ours cannot be
consummated to-day; let us separate for the present and make plans for
our union in the future.&rsquo; I asked her how we could do so, and she
replied, &lsquo;I have sworn my soul to you, and it is decided for
ever, but you have your parents to think of, and you have not yet had a
wife chosen, so there will be no chance of their advising you to have a
second wife as my social standing would require for me. As I reflect
upon your ability and chances for promotion, I see you already a
Minister of State. Let us separate just now, and I&rsquo;ll keep myself
for you till the time when you win the first place at the Examination
and have your <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3228" href=
"#xd25e3228" name="xd25e3228">237</a>]</span>three days of public
rejoicing. Then we&rsquo;ll meet once more. Let us make a compact never
to be broken. So then, until you have won your honours, do not think of
me, please. Do not be anxious, either, lest I should be taken from you,
for I have a plan by which to hide myself away in safety. Know that on
the day when you win your honours we shall meet again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this we clasped hands and spoke our farewells as though we
parted easily. Where she was going I did not ask, but simply came home
with a distressed and burdened heart, feeling that I had lost
everything. On my return I found that my parents, who had missed me,
were in a terrible state of consternation, but so delighted were they
at my safe return that they scarcely asked where I had been. I did not
tell them either, but gave another excuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first I could not desist from thoughts of Ta-hong. After a
long time only was I able to regain my composure. From that time forth
with all my might I went at my lessons. Day and night I pegged away,
not for the sake of the Examination, but for the sake of once more
meeting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In two years or so my parents appointed my marriage. I did
not dare to refuse, had to accept, but had no heart in it, and no joy
in their choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gift for study was very marked, and by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3238" href="#xd25e3238" name=
"xd25e3238">238</a>]</span>diligence I grew to be superior to all my
competitors. It was five years after my farewell to Ta-hong that I won
my honours. I was still but a youngster, and all the world rejoiced in
my success. But my joy was in the secret understanding that the time
had come for me to meet Ta-hong. On the first day of my graduation
honours I expected to meet her, but did not. The second day passed, but
I saw nothing of her, and the third day was passing and no word had
reached me. My heart was so disturbed that I found not the slightest
joy in the honours of the occasion. Evening was falling, when my father
said to me, &lsquo;I have a friend of my younger days, who now lives in
Chang-eui ward, and you must go and call on him this evening before the
three days are over,&rsquo; and so, there being no help for it, I went
to pay my call. As I was returning the sun had gone down and it was
dark, and just as I was passing a high gateway, I heard the
<i>Sillai</i> call.<a class="noteref" id="xd25e3243src" href=
"#xd25e3243" name="xd25e3243src">1</a> It was the home of an old
Minister, a man whom I did not know, but he being a high noble there
was nothing for me to do but to dismount and enter. Here I found the
master himself, an old gentleman, who put me through my humble
exercises, and then ordered me gently to come up and sit beside him. He
talked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3246" href="#xd25e3246" name=
"xd25e3246">239</a>]</span>to me very kindly, and entertained me with
all sorts of refreshments. Then he lifted his glass and inquired,
&lsquo;Would you like to meet a very beautiful person?&rsquo; I did not
know what he meant, and so asked, &lsquo;What beautiful person?&rsquo;
The old man said, &lsquo;The most beautiful in the world to you. She
has long been a member of my household.&rsquo; Then he ordered a
servant to call her. When she came it was my lost Ta-hong. I was
startled, delighted, surprised, and speechless almost. &lsquo;How do
you come here?&rsquo; I gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She laughed and said, &lsquo;Is this not within the three
days of your public celebration, and according to the agreement by
which we parted?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man said, &lsquo;She is a wonderful woman. Her
thoughts are high and noble, and her history is quite unique. I will
tell it to you. I am an old man of eighty, and my wife and I have had
no children, but on a certain day this young girl came to us saying,
&ldquo;May I have the place of slave with you, to wait on you and do
your bidding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;In surprise I asked the reason for this strange
request, and she said, &ldquo;I am not running away from any master, so
do not mistrust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Still, I did not wish to take her in, and told
her so, but she begged so persuasively that I yielded and let her stay,
appointed her work to do, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3256"
href="#xd25e3256" name="xd25e3256">240</a>]</span>and watched her
behaviour. She became a slave of her own accord, and simply lived to
please us, preparing our meals during the day, and caring for our rooms
for the night; responding to calls; ever ready to do our bidding;
faithful beyond compare. We feeble old folks, often ill, found her a
source of comfort and cheer unheard of, making life perfect peace and
joy. Her needle, too, was exceedingly skilful, and according to the
seasons she prepared all that we needed. Naturally we loved and pitied
her more than I can say. My wife thought more of her than ever mother
did of a daughter. During the day she was always at hand, and at night
she slept by her side. At one time I asked her quietly concerning her
past history. She said she was originally the child of a free-man, but
that her parents had died when she was very young, and, having no place
to go to, an old woman of the village had taken her in and brought her
up. &ldquo;Being so young,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I was safe from
harm. At last I met a young master with whom I plighted a hundred years
of troth, a beautiful boy, none was ever like him. I determined to meet
him again, but only after he had won his honours in the arena. If I had
remained at the home of the old mother I could not have kept myself
safe, and preserved my honour; I would have been helpless; so I came
here for safety <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3258" href=
"#xd25e3258" name="xd25e3258">241</a>]</span>and to serve you. It is a
plan by which to hide myself for a year or so, and then when he wins I
shall ask your leave to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I then asked who the person was with whom she
had made this contract, and she told me your name. I am so old that I
no longer think of taking wives and concubines, but she called herself
my concubine so as to be safe, and thus the years have passed. We
watched the Examination reports, but till this time your name was
absent. Through it all she expressed not a single word of anxiety, but
kept up heart saying that before long your name would appear. So
confident was she that not a shadow of disappointment was in her face.
This time on looking over the list I found your name, and told her. She
heard it without any special manifestation of joy, saying she knew it
would come. She also said, &ldquo;When we parted I promised to meet him
before the three days of public celebration were over, and now I must
make good my promise.&rdquo; So she climbed to the upper pavilion to
watch the public way. But this ward being somewhat remote she did not
see you going by on the first day, nor on the second. This morning she
went again, saying, &ldquo;He will surely pass to-day&rdquo;; and so it
came about. She said, &ldquo;He is coming; call him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;I am an old man and have read much history,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3265" href="#xd25e3265" name=
"xd25e3265">242</a>]</span>and have heard of many famous women. There
are many examples of devotion that move the heart, but I never saw so
faithful a life nor one so devoted to another. God taking note of this
has brought all her purposes to pass. And now, not to let this moment
of joy go by, you must stay with me to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I met Ta-hong I was most happy, especially as I heard of
her years of faithfulness. As to the invitation I declined it, saying I
could not think, even though we had so agreed, of taking away one who
waited in attendance upon His Excellency. But the old man laughed,
saying, &lsquo;She is not mine. I simply let her be called my concubine
in name lest my nephews or some younger members of the clan should
steal her away. She is first of all a faithful woman: I have not known
her like before.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man then had the horse sent back and the servants,
also a letter to my parents saying that I would stay the night. He
ordered the servants to prepare a room, to put in beautiful screens and
embroidered matting, to hang up lights and to decorate as for a
bridegroom. Thus he celebrated our meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning I bade good-bye, and went and told my parents
all about my meeting with Ta-hong and what had happened. They gave
consent that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3273" href="#xd25e3273"
name="xd25e3273">243</a>]</span>I should have her, and she was brought
and made a member of our family, really my only wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her life and behaviour being beyond that of the ordinary, in
serving those above her and in helping those below, she fulfilled all
the requirements of the ancient code. Her work, too, was faithfully
done, and her gifts in the way of music and chess were most
exceptional. I loved her as I never can tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little later I went as magistrate to Keumsan county in
Chulla Province, and Ta-hong went with me. We were there for two years.
She declined our too frequent happy times together, saying that it
interfered with efficiency and duty. One day, all unexpectedly, she
came to me and requested that we should have a little quiet time, with
no others present, as she had something special to tell me. I asked her
what it was, and she said to me, &lsquo;I am going to die, for my span
of life is finished; so let us be glad once more and forget all the
sorrows of the world.&rsquo; I wondered when I heard this. I could not
think it true, and asked her how she could tell beforehand that she was
going to die. She said, &lsquo;I know, there is no mistake about
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In four or five days she fell ill, but not seriously, and yet
a day or two later she died. She said to me when dying, &lsquo;Our life
is ordered, God decides it all. While I lived I gave myself to you,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3281" href="#xd25e3281" name=
"xd25e3281">244</a>]</span>and you most kindly responded in return. I
have no regrets. As I die I ask only that my body be buried where it
may rest by the side of my master when he passes away, so that when we
meet in the regions beyond I shall be with you once again.&rsquo; When
she had so said she died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her face was beautiful, not like the face of the dead, but
like the face of the living. I was plunged into deepest grief, prepared
her body with my own hands for burial. Our custom is that when a second
wife dies she is not buried with the family, but I made some excuse and
had her interred in our family site in the county of Ko-yang. I did so
to carry out her wishes. When I came as far as Keum-chang on my sad
journey, I wrote a verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&lsquo;O beautiful Bud, of the beautiful Flower,</p>
<p class="line xd25e2435">We bear thy form on the willow bier;</p>
<p class="line">Whither has gone thy sweet perfumed soul?</p>
<p class="line xd25e2435">The rains fall on us</p>
<p class="line">To tell us of thy tears and of thy faithful
way.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">&ldquo;I wrote this as a love tribute to my faithful
Ta-hong. After her death, whenever anything serious was to happen in my
home, she always came to tell me beforehand, and never was there a
mistake in her announcements. For several years it has continued thus,
till a few days ago she appeared in a dream saying, &lsquo;Master, the
time of your departure has come, and we are to meet again. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd25e3298" href="#xd25e3298" name=
"xd25e3298">245</a>]</span>I am now making ready for your glad
reception.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For this reason I have bidden all my associates farewell.
Last night she came once more and said to me, &lsquo;To-morrow is your
day.&rsquo; We wept together in the dream as we met and talked. In the
morning, when I awoke, marks of tears were still upon my cheeks. This
is not because I fear to die, but because I have seen my Ta-hong. Now
that you have asked me I have told you all. Tell it to no one.&rdquo;
So Sim died, as was foretold, on the day following. Strange,
indeed!</p>
